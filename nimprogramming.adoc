In the year 1970 {wirth} invented the [.ndef]#Pascal# programming language to teach
his students the fundamentals of computer programming. While the initial core Pascal
language was designed for teaching purposes only, it was soon expanded by commercial
vendors and got some popularity. Later Wirth presented the language [.ndef]#Modula-2#
with improved syntax and support of modules for larger projects, and the
[.ndef]#Oberon# language family with additional support for [.ndef]#Object Oriented
Programming#.

The [.ndef]#Nim# programming language can be seen in this tradition, as it is
basically an easy language suited for beginners with no prior programming experience,
but at the same time is not restricted in any way. Nim offers all the concepts of
modern and powerful programming languages in combination with high performance and
some sort of universality -- Nim can be used to create programs for tiny
{uc} as well as for large desktop apps and web applications.

Most books about programming languages concentrate on the language itself and assume
that the reader is already familiar with the foundations of computer hardware and
already has some programming experience. This is generally a valid approach, as today
most people are taught this fundamental knowledge, sometimes called [.ndef]#Computer
Science# (CS) in school. But still there are people who missed this introduction in
school for various reasons and decide later that they need some programming skills,
maybe for a technical job. And there may exist some children that are not satisfied
with the introduction to computer science taught at school. So we have decided to
start this book with a short introduction to fundamental concepts -- most people can
skip that part. In part II we explain the basics of computer programming step by step
in a way which should enable even children to learn independently. Part III will give
you an overview of the Nim standard library and part IV will introduce some useful
external packages. Part V will introduce advanced concepts like [.ndef]#asynchronous
operations#, [.ndef]#threading# and [.ndef]#parallel processing#, and [.ndef]#macros#
and [.ndef]#meta-programming#. Nim macros are very powerful but difficult at first.
Part VI may finally present some advanced examples.

While Nim has a JavaScript backend and so supports web related development well,
this book concentrates on native code generation using the C and {cpp} backends.
We will discuss some peculiarities of the JavaScript backend in the second half
of the book, and we may give some complete examples for the use of the JavaScript
backend in the final part VI of the book. If you are strongly interested in web
development and the JavaScript backend, then you may also consult the book
[.ndef]#Nim in Action# of Dominik Picheta, which gives some detailed examples for the
development of web based software with the Nim programming language, including
a simple chat application and the skeleton of a microblogging and social networking service.
And you may consult the tutorials and manuals of Nim web packages like
[.ndef]#Karax# and [.ndef]#Jester#.

This book is based on the Nim reference implementation ({curnim}) of the team around Mr. A. Rumpf -- other
implementations where not available in 2020 when the initial version of the book was created.
If this should change later and Nim implementations with significantly different behaviour
may become available, then we may add remarks where necessary. 

= Part I: Introduction

[.normal]
For using computers and writing computer programs you initially do not have to know
many details. It is basically like driving a car: Although a car is a powerful and
complicated tool, kids generally can drive it after a 3-minute introduction.  Still,
good racing drivers generally need a much broader insight into the inner working of
all the technical components, and finally, a lot of practice.

== What is a Computer?

A computer is primarily a device which can run computer programs.
Nearly all computers currently in use, from the tiny ones integrated in electronic
gadgets, the well known desktop computers (PC), to large and powerful super
computers filling whole rooms, work internally with digital data only.footnote:[In
the past some form of analog computers existed, some worked mechanically, some used
analog voltages or currents as input and output signals. Indeed one important device
which is still very common in analog electronics is the summing amplifier, which can
sum up multiple electric voltages.] Digital data is basically integer (whole)
numbers encoded in binary form, represented by sequences of the symbols [.ndef]#0# and [.ndef]#1#.
We will discuss the term digital in the next section in more detail.

The most important part of a digital computer is the [.ndef]#CPU#, the
[.ndef]#Central Processing Unit#. That tiny device is built of digital electronic
circuits and can perform very basic mathematical and logical operations on numbers,
like adding two numbers or deciding if a number is larger or smaller than another
number. Most computer CPU's can only store very few numbers internally, and forget
the numbers when the power is switched off. So the CPU is generally electrically
connected to a [.ndef]#RAM# module, a [.ndef]#Random Access Memory#, which can store
many more numbers and allow fast access to these numbers, and to a [.ndef]#Harddisk#
or [.ndef]#SSD# device which can permanently store the numbers, but does not allow
such fast access. The stored numbers are most often called just [.ndef]#data# --
basically that data is nothing more than numbers, but it can be interpreted in many
different ways, as pictures, sounds and much more.

Nearly all of today's desktop computers, and even most notebooks and cellphones
contain not only a single CPU, but multiple CPUs, also called "Cores", so they can
run different programs in parallel, or a single program can run parts of it on
different CPUs, to increase performance or reduce total execution time. The so
called super computers can contain thousands of CPUs. Beside CPUs most computers
have also at least one [.ndef]#GPU#, a [.ndef]#Graphic Processing Unit#, that can be
used to display data on a screen or monitor, maybe for doing animations in games or
for playing video. The distinction between CPU and GPU is not really sharp; generally
a CPU can also display data on screens and monitors, and GPUs can do also some data
processing that CPUs can do. But GPUs are optimized for the data display task.

More visible to the ordinary computer user are the peripheral devices like keyboard,
mouse, screen and maybe a printer. These enable human interaction with the computer,
but are in no way a core component of it; the computer can run well without them. In
notebook or laptop computers or in cellphones, the peripheral devices are closely
integrated with the core components.  All the physical parts of a computer are also
called [.ndef]#hardware#, while the programs running on that hardware are called
[.ndef]#software#.

A less visible but also very important class of computers are [.ndef]#{uc}# and so
called [.ndef]#embedded devices#, tiny pieces with generally a hull of black plastic
with some electrical contacts. The devices generally contain all necessary elements,
that is the CPU, some RAM and a persistent storage that can store programs when no
electric power supply is available. These devices may be restricted in computing
power and the amount of data that they can store and process, but they are contained
in many devices.  They control your washing machine, refrigerator, television and
radio and much more. Some devices in your home may even contain multiple {uc}s and
often the {uc}s can already communicate with each other by RF (Radio-Frequency), or
access by WLAN the internet, which is sometimes called [.ndef]#Internet of Things#
(IoT).

Another class of large and very powerful digital computers are called
[.ndef]#mainframe computers# or [.ndef]#super computers#, which are optimized to
process large amount of data very fast. The key to their gigantic computing power is
that many fast CPUs work in parallel -- the problem or task is split into many small
parts that are solved by one CPU each, and the final result is then the combination
of all the solved sub-tasks. Unfortunately it is not always possible to split large
problems into smaller sub-tasks.

Digital computers are generally driven by a clock signal that pulses at a certain frequency.
The CPU can do simple operations like the addition of two integers at each pulse of
the clock signal. For more complicated operations like a multiplication or a division
it may need more clock pulses.

//Digital computers are generally driven by a rectangular shaped binary clock signal, that is
//an electrical voltage that jumps continuously from maybe a level of 0 Volt to a level
//of 1 Volt and back. The CPU can do simple operations like the addition of two
//integers for each (upwards) transition of the clock signal, for more complicated
//operations like a multiplication or a division it may need more clock periods.

So a rough measure for the performance of a computer is the clock rate, that is the
number of clock pulses per second, divided by the number of pulses that the CPU needs
to perform a basic operation, multiplied by the number of CPUs or Cores that the
computer can use. 

A totally different kind of computers are [.ndef]#Quantum Computers#, large,
expensive high-tech devices, which use the rules of [.ndef]#quantum mechanics# to
calculate many computations in parallel. Today only a few of them exist, for research
at universities and some large commercial institutes. Quantum computers may at some
time in the future fundamentally change computing and our whole world, but they are
not the topic of this book.

== Analog and Digital

Whenever we measure a quantity based on one tiny base unit, then we work in the
digital area, we measure with some granularity.  Our ordinary money is digital in
some way, as the cent is the smallest base unit; you will never pay a fraction of a
cent for something.  Time can be seen as a digital quantity as long as we accepts the
second as the smallest unit.  Even on so called analogue watches the second hand will
generally jump forwards in steps of a second, so you can not measure fractions of a
seconds with that watch.

An obvious analogue property is the thermodynamic temperature and its classic
measurement device is the well known capillary thermometer consisting of a glass
capillary filled with alcohol or liquid mercury. When temperature increases the
liquid in a reservoir expand more than the surrounding glass and partly fills the
capillary.  That filling rate is an analogue measure for the temperature.

While the hourglass
works digitally (you can count the tiny sand stones), the sundial does not.

Most of the quantities in our real world seem analog,
and digital quantities seem to be some sort of arbitrary approximation.
//All the quantities in our real world seems to be not digital or granular,
//so digital quantities seems to be some sort of arbitrary approximation.

But [.ndef]#quantum mechanics# has taught us that many quantities in our world really
have a granularity. Physically quantities like energy or momentum are indeed
multiplies of the tiny [.ndef]#planck constant#. Or consider electric charge, which
is always a multiple of the [.ndef]#elementary charge unit# of one electron. Whenever
an electrical current is flowing through an electrically conducting wire, an ionized
gas or an electrolyte like salt water, there are flowing multiplies of the elementary
charge only, never fractions of it. And of course light and electromagnetic radiation
also has some form of granularity, which the photoelectric effect as well as compton
scattering proves.

An important and useful property of digital signals and digital data is that they map
directly to integral numbers.

The simplest form of digital data is binary data, which can have only two distinct
values. When you use a mechanical switch to turn the light bulb in your house on or
of, you change the binary state of the bulb. And your neighbor, when watching your
house, receives binary signals.footnote:[Well, when we watch very carefully, we will
notice that the signal is not really digital -- when we switch on, the filament may
take a few milliseconds to heat up, and when we switch off, the filament takes again
a few milliseconds to cool down.]

Digital computers are generally using binary electric states internally -- voltage or
current [.term]#on# or [.term]#off#. Such a on/off state is called a bit. We will
learn more about bits and binary logic later. One bit can store obviously only two
states, which we may map to the numbers [.term]#0# and [.term]#1#. Larger integer numbers can be
represented by a sequence of multiple bits.

The [.ndef]#morse code# was an early application to transmit messages encoded in
binary form.

A very important property of digital encoded numbers (data) is that they can be
copied and transmitted exactly. The reason for this is that digital numbers have a
well defined clean state, there is no noise which overlays the data and may
accumulate when the data is copied multiple times. Well, that statement is not really
true -- under bad conditions the noise can become so large that it changes the binary
state of signals. Imagine we try to transfer some whole numbers encoded in binary
form, maybe by binary states encoded as voltage level [.term]#0 Volt# and [.term]#5 Volt#, over an
electric wire and a long distance.  It is clear that the long wire can pick up some
electromagnetic noise that can change the true 0 Volt data to a voltage that is
closer to 5 Volt than to the true 0 Volt level, so it is received incorrectly. To
catch such types of transmission errors [.ndef]#checksums# are added to the actual
data.  A checksum is derived by a special mathematical formula from the original data and
transferred with it. The receiver applies the same formula to the received data and
compares the result with the received checksum. If it does not match, then it is
clear that data transmission is corrupted, and a resend is requested.

// I think you should leave the following statement out, or omit the whole paragraph.  -Jim
//But the field of data transmission and its error detection is not the topic of this book.

The opposite of digital is generally called analogue, a term which is used for data
which have or seems to have no granularity. For example we speak of an analogue
voltage when the voltage can have each value in a given range and when the voltage
does not "jump" but change continuous.footnote:[Of course even digital electric
signals can not really "jump" from one digital state to another, but the transition
time is much shorter than the time duration of the steady state, so the signal has a
rectangular shape when we watch it on an oscilloscope, it looks like +__--__--__+.]
For observing analogue voltages or currents one can use a moving coil meter, a device
where the current flows through a coil in a magnetic field and the magnetic force
moves the hand/pointer.

We said in the previous section that nearly all of our current computers work with
digital data only. Basically that is that they work internally with integer numbers,
stored in sequences of binary bits. All input for computers must have the form of
integer numbers, and all output has the form of integer numbers.  Whenever we want to
feed computers with some sort of analogue data, like an analogue voltage, we have to
convert it into a digital approximation.  For that task special devices called
[.ndef]#analog to digital converters# (ADC) exists. And in some cases we have to
convert the digital output data of computers to analogue signals, like when a
computer plays music: The computer output in form of digital data is then converted
by a device called [.ndef]#digital to analog converter# (DAC) into an analogue
voltage, that generates an analogue current through a coil in the speakers of our
sound box, and that electric current in the coil generates a magnetic field which
exercise mechanical forces and moves the membrane of the speaker, resulting in
oscillating motions, which generates air pressure variations that our ear can detect
and that we finally hear as sound.

== What is an Operating System?

Most computers, from cellphones to large super computers, use an [.ndef]#{os}# (OS).
A well known OS is the GNU/Linux kernel. Operating Systems can be seen as the initial
program that is loaded and started when we switch the computer on and that works as
some kind of supervisor:footnote:[Well, before the OS is loaded and starts execution, often
another tiny program called a [.new]#Boot Manager# is launched. Boot managers
are used to select different {os} to boot, maybe Linux or Windows, or too pass
parameters as the hard disk boot partition number to the OS.] it can load other programs and it distributes resources like
CPU cores or RAM between multiple running programs. It also controls user input by
keyboard and mouse, displays output data on the screen -- as text or graphics,
controls how data is loaded and stored to nonvolatile storage media like hard-disk or
SSD, manages all the network traffic and many more tasks.  An important task of the
OS is to allow user programs to access all the various hardware components from
different vendors in a uniform high level manner.  An OS can be seen as an
intermediate layer between user programs like a text processor or a game, and the
hardware of the computer.  The OS allows user programs to work on a higher level of
abstraction, so they do not need to know much about the low level hardware details.

Current Linux kernel version 5.6 has 28 million lines of source code!

Small {uc}s and embedded devices often do not need to use an {os}, as they generally
run only one single user program and because they usually do not have a large variety
of hardware components to support.

== What is Computer Programming?

Computer programming includes the creation, testing and optimizing of computer
programs.

== What is a Computer Program?

A computer program is basically a sequence of numbers, which make some sense to a
computer CPU, in such a way that the CPU recognizes the numbers as so called
[.ndef]#instructions# or [.ndef]#numeric machine code#, maybe the instruction to add
two numbers.

The first computers, built in the 1950's, were indeed programmed by feeding sequences
of plain numbers to the device. The numbers were stored on so called [.ndef]#punch
cards#, consisting of strong paper where the numbers were encoded by holes in the
cards. The holes could be recognized by electrical contacts to feed the numbers into
the CPU. As plain numbers do not match well human thinking, soon more abstract codes
where used. A very direct code, which matches numerical instructions to symbols, is
the [.ndef]#assembly language#. In that language for example the character sequence
"add A0, $8" may map directly to a sequence of numbers which instructs the CPU to add
the constant integer number 8 to CPU register A0, where A0 is a storage area in the
CPU where numbers can be stored. As there exists many different types of CPUs all
with their own instruction sets, there exists many different assembly instruction
sets, with similar, but not identical instructions. The rules that describe how these
basic instructions have to look are called the [.ndef]#syntax# of the assembly
language.

The numerical machine code or the corresponding assembly language is the most basic
instruction set for a CPU.  Every instruction which a CPU can execute maps to a
well-defined assembly instruction. So each operation that a computer may be able to
perform can be expressed in a sequence of assembly instructions. But complicated
tasks may require millions of assembly instructions, which would take humans very
long to write, and even much longer to modify, proof and debug.footnote:[The search
for the reason why a program does not do exactly what was hoped for by its creators
is called debugging. That term is still a legacy from the very first computers in the
50's, where logical circuits where built by mechanical relays, for example a logical
[.term]#and# operation was built by two relays in series connection.  To let the
current flow, both of them would have to be in the conducting state. And it was told
that sometimes insects walked onto the electric contacts of the relays and blocked
them. Today, misbehavior of computer programs is rarely due to hardware faults, but
the term "bugs" for errors and "debugging" for finding and fixing the errors, was
kept.]

Just a few years after the invention of the first computers, people recognized that
they would need even more abstract instruction sets, like repeated execution,
composed conditionals, or other data types than plain numbers as operands. So
higher level programming languages like Algol, Fortran, C, Pascal or Basic where
created.

//Simple C program here, with its assembly code from godbolt.org.

== What is an Algorithm?

An [.ndef]#algorithm# is a detailed sequence of more or less abstract instructions to
solve a specific task or to reach a goal. Cooking recipe books and car repair
instructions are examples of algorithms. The basic math operations kids learn in
school to add, multiply or divide two numbers with paper and pencil are algorithms
too. Even starting a car follows an algorithm -- when the temperature is below zero
and snow covers the vehicle, than you first have to clean the windows and lights. And
when you first drive again after a longer break you would have to check the tires
before you start the engine. Algorithm can be carried out by strictly following the
instructions -- it is not necessary to really understand how and why it works.

So an algorithm is a perfect fit for a computer, as computers are really good at
following instructions without really understanding what they are trying to
accomplish.

A math algorithm to sum up the first 100 natural numbers may look like

[source]
----
use two integer variables called i and sum
assign the value 0 to both variables

while i is less than 100 do:
  increase i by one
  add value of i to sum

optionally print the final value of sum
----

== What is a Programming Language?

Most traditional programming languages were created to map algorithms to elementary
CPU instructions. Algorithms generally contain nested conditionals, repetition, math
operations, recovery from errors and maybe plausibility checks. Complicated algorithm
generally can be split into various logical parts, which may include reading in data,
multiple processing steps, and storing or displaying data as plain text, graphic or
animation. This splitting into parts is mapped to programming languages by grouping
tasks into subroutines, functions or procedures which accept a set of input
parameters and can return a result. As algorithms often work not only with numbers,
but also with text, it makes sense to have a form of textual data type in a
programming language too. And all the data types can be grouped in various ways, for
example as sequences of multiple data of the same type, like lists of numbers or
names. Or as collections of different types, like name, age and profession of a
citizen in an income tax database. For all these use cases programming languages
provide some sort of support.

== Compilers and Interpreters

We already learned that the CPU in the computer can execute only simple instructions,
which we call numeric machine code or assembly instructions.

To run a program written in a high level language with many abstractions we need some
sort of converter to transfer that program to the basic instructions that the CPU can
execute. For the conversion process we have basically two options: We can convert the
whole program into machine code, store it to disk, and than run it on the CPU. Or we
can convert it in small portions, maybe line by line, and run each portion whenever
we have converted it. Tools that convert the whole program first are called
compilers. [.ndef]#Compilers# process the program that we have written, include other
source code like needed library modules, check the code for obvious errors and then
generate and store the machine code that we then can run.  Tools that process the
source code in small portions, like single statements, are called
[.ndef]#interpreters#. They read in a line of source code, investigate it to check if
it is a valid statement, and then feed the CPU with corresponding instructions to
execute it. It is similar to picking strawberries: you can pick one and eat it at
once, or you can put them all into a basket and eat them later.  Both interpreters
and compilers have advantages and disadvantages for special use cases.  Compilers can
already detect errors before the program is run, and compiled programs generally run
fast, as all the instructions are already available when the programs runs. The
compiling step takes some time of course, at least a few seconds, but for some
languages and large programs it may take much longer. That can make the software
development process slow because as you add or change code, you have to compile it
before you can execute and test your program. That may be inconvenient for unskilled
programmers as they may have to do much testing. Some use a programming style that
is: change a tiny bit of the source code, then run it and see what is does.  But a
more common practice is that you think about the problem first and then write the
code, that then in most cases does nearly that what you intended. For this style of
programming you do not have to compile and execute your code that often. Compilers
have one important benefit: they can detect many bugs, mostly typing errors, already
in the compile phase, and they give you a detailed error message. Interpreters have
the advantage that you can modify your code and immediately execute it without delay.
That is nice for learning a new language and for some fast tests, but even simple
typing errors can only be detected when they are encountered while running the
program. If your test does not try to run a faulty statement, there will be no error,
but it may occur later.  Generally interpreted program execution is much slower than
running compiled executables, as the interpreter has to continually process the
source code, while the compiler does it only once before the program is run. At the
end of this section a few additional notes: Compilers are sometimes supported by so
called linkers. In that case the compiler converts the source code, that can be
stored in multiple text files, each in a sequence of machine code instructions, and
finally the linker joins all these machine code files to the final executable. Some
compilers do not need the linking step or call the linker automatically. And some
interpreters convert the textual source code in one very fast, initial pre-processing
step ("on the fly") to so called byte code, that can then be interpreted faster. The languages
Ruby and Python do that.  Some languages like Java can compile and optimize the
source code while the program is running. For that process a so called virtual
machine is used, that builds an intermediate layer between the hardware and the user
program.

== Types of Programming Languages

We already mentioned the assembly languages, which provide only the basic operations
that the CPU can perform. Assembly languages provide no abstractions, so maybe we
should not even call them programming languages at all. Then there are low level
languages like Fortran or C, with some basic abstractions which
still work close to the hardware and which are mostly designed for high performance and low resource consumption (RAM) but not
to detect and prevent programming errors or to make life easy for programmers.
These languages supports already some higher order data types like floating point numbers or text (strings),
and homogeneous, fixed size containers (called arrays in C) or  heterogeneous fixed size
containers (called structs in C).
 
A different approach is taken by languages like Python or Ruby, which try to make
writing code easier by offering many high level abstractions and which have better
protection against errors, but are not as efficient. These languages support also
dynamic containers which can grow and shrink, or advanced data structures
like hash tables (maps) or support for textual pattern matching by regular expressions (regex).

Another way to differentiate programming languages is if they are statically or
dynamically typed. Ruby and Python are two examples of dynamically typed languages,
that is, they use variables which can store any data type, and the variable's type
can change during program execution. That seems comfortable for the user, and
sometimes it is, especially for short programs which may be written for one-time use
only and are sometimes called scripts. But dynamic typing makes discovery of logical
errors harder -- an illegal addition of a number to a letter may be detected only at
run-time.  And dynamically typed languages generally waste a lot of memory and their
performance is not that great.
It is as you would own many moving boxes and you store all
your goods in it, each piece in one box.

For statically typed languages each variable has a well defined data type like
integer number, real number, a single letter, a text element and many more. The data
type is assigned by the author of the program with a type declaration or is detected
by the compiler when processing the program source code, called type inference, and
the variable's type does never change. In this way the compiler can
check for logical errors early in the compile process, and the compiler can reserve
memory blocks exactly customized to the variables that we want to store, so total
memory consumption and performance can be optimized.
Referring again to our boxes example, statically typing is like using customized
boxes for all your goods.  

All these types of programming languages are often called imperative programming
languages, as the program describes detailed what to do. There are other types of
programming languages too, for example languages like Prolog, which try to give only
a set of rules and then let the computer try to solve a problem with these rules. And
of course there are the new concepts of [.ndef]#artificial intelligence# (AI) and
[.ndef]#machine learning# (ML), which are less based on algorithms and more on neural nets which
are trained with a lot of data until it provides the desired results. Nim, the
computer language this book is about, is an imperative language, so we will focus on
the imperative programming style in this book. But of course Nim can be used to
create AI applications.

Further, we differentiate between languages like C, {cpp}, Rust, Nim and many more that compile to native executables and
can run directly on the hardware of the computer, languages like Java, Scala, Julia
and some more that use a large [.ndef]#Virtual Machine# (VM) as an intermediate layer
between the program and the hardware, and interpreted languages like Ruby and Python.
Languages using a virtual machine generally need some startup time when a program is
invoked, as the VM must be loaded and initialized, and interpreted languages are
generally not very fast.footnote:[Exactly speaking Ruby and Python do not really
interpret the source code, but compile it on the fly to byte-code, which is then
interpreted. And there exists some variants of Ruby and Python that compile with some
success to native machine code. Crystal is a variant of Ruby, with some significant
differences that compiles to fast native machine code.] The distinction between
languages that compile to native executables or that are executed on a virtual machine
is not really sharp. For example Kotlin and Julia where executed on a virtual machine
initially, but now can compile the source code to native executables. 

An important class of programming languages are the so called [.ndef]#{oop}# (OOP)
languages, which uses inheritance and dynamic dispatch, and become popular in the 1990's. For some time it was assumed that
{oop} was the ultimate solution to manage and structure really large programs. Java
was the most prominent example of the OOP languages. Java forces the programmer to
use OOP design, and languages like {cpp}, Python or Ruby strongly push programmer to
use OPP design. Practice has shown that OOP design is not the ultimate solution for
all computing problems, and OPP design may prevent optimal performance. So newer
languages like Go, Rust and Nim support some form of OOP programming, but use it only
as one paradigm among many other.

Another popular and important class of programming languages is JavaScript and its
more modern cousins like TypeScript, Kotlin or Dart and others. JavaScript was
designed to run in web browsers to support interactive web pages and programs and
games running in the browser. In this way the program became nearly independent from
the native operating system of the computer. Note that unlike the name may indicate,
JavaScript is not closely related to the Java language.  Nim can compile to a
JavaScript backend, so it supports web development well.

****
Sometimes source code written in one programming language is converted into another one. A
prominent target for such conversions is JavaScript, as JavaScript enables 
execution of programs in web browsers. Another important target language
is C or {cpp}. Creating intermediate C code, which is then compiled by a C compiler to native
executables has some advantages compared to direct compilation to native executables:
C compilers exists for nearly all computer systems including {mc}s and embedded systems,
so the use of a language is not restricted to systems for which a native compiler backend is provided.
And C as intermediate code simplifies the use of system libraries which
generally provide a C compatible interface.
Due to decades of development C compilers generally can do better code optimizations
than young languages may manage to do. Some people fear that intermediate C code
carries the problems of the C language, like verbosity, confusing and error-prone code or
undefined behavior to the source languages. But these well known problems of C occur
only when humans write C code directly, in the same way when humans write assembly code directly.
Automatic conversions are well defined and well tested, which means they are free of errors
to the same degree as direct machine code generation would be. But indeed there are
some small drawbacks when C or {cpp} is used as backend of a programming language:
C does not always allow direct access to all CPU instructions, which may make it difficult
to generate optimal code for some special constructs like exceptions. And C uses
wrap around arithmetic for unsigned integer types, which may not be what modern
languages desire. The current Nim implementation provides a JavaScript and a C and {cpp}
backend. While the JavaScript backend is a design decision to enable web development, the
C and {cpp} backends are more a pragmatic decision, and may be later replaced or at least
supported by direct native code generation or use of the popular LLVM backend. footnote:[Indeed
an experimental LLVM backend is already available by third party contributors.]
When computer languages are converted from one language to another, then sometimes the
term [.ndef]#transpiler# is used to differentiate the translation process to a direct compilation
to a binary executable. When program code is converted between very similar languages with
nearly the same level of abstractions, then the term transpiler may be justified. But Nim is
very different from C and has a higher abstraction level, and the Nim compiler performs
many advanced optimizations.
So it should be not called a transpiler, even when compiling to JavaScript or to the {cpp} backend.

== Why Nim?

NOTE: In this section we are using a lot of new Computer Science (CS) expressions but
do not explain them.  That is intentional -- when you already know them you may get a
better feeling of what Nim is, and when you do not know them you will at least learn
that we can describe Nim with fancy-sounding terms.

Three well known traditional programming languages are C, Java and Python. C is
//When a group of words are used together as 1 adjective to describe a noun, the
//group of words is hyphenated because together they are 1 adjective for 1 noun.
//Or you could put them in quotes, like "close to the hardware" language.  -J
basically a simple, close-to-the-hardware language created in 1972, for which
compilers can generate fast, highly optimized native machine code, but it has cryptic
syntax, some strange semantics, and is missing higher concepts of modern languages.
Java, created in 1995, forces you strongly to the object-orientated style of
programming (OOP) and runs on a virtual machine, which makes it unsuitable for
embedded systems and {uc}s. Python, created in 1991, is generally interpreted instead
of compiled, which makes program execution not very fast, and it does not really
allow writing low level code which operates close to the hardware. Of course there
are many more programming languages, each with its own advantages and disadvantages,
with some optimized for special use cases.

//state-of-the-art is usually hyphenated, because of the rule I mentioned above.
//the same with Python-like syntax.  -J
Nim is a state-of-the-art programming language well suited for systems and
application programming. Its clean Python-like syntax makes programming easy and fun
for beginners, without applying any restrictions to experienced systems programmers.
Nim combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula
with a few established features of the latest research. It offers high performance
with type and memory safety while keeping the source code short and readable. The
compiler itself and the generated executables support all major platforms including
Windows, Linux, BSD and Mac OS X. The custom package managers, Nimble or Nimph, makes use and
redistribution of programs and libraries easy and secure. Nim supports various
"backends" to generate the final code.  The C, {cpp} and LLVM-based backends allow easy OS
library calls without additional glue code, while the JavaScript backend generates
high quality code for web applications. The integrated "Read/Eval/Print Loop" (REPL),
"Hot code reloading", incremental compilation, and support of various development
environments including debugging and language server protocols makes working with Nim
productive and enjoyable.

=== Nim is Efficient

Nim is a compiled and statically-typed language. While for interpreted,
dynamically-typed languages like Python we have to run every statement to check even
for trivial errors, the Nim compiler checks for most errors during the compile
process. The static typing together with the well-designed Nim type system allows the
compiler to catch most errors already in the compile phase, like the undefined
addition of a number and a letter, and to report the errors in the terminal window or
directly in the editor or IDE. When no errors are found or all errors have been
fixed, then the compiler generates highly optimized dependency free executables. And
this compilation process is generally really fast, for example the compiler compiles
itself in maybe 10 to 30 seconds on a typical modern PC.footnote:[Indeed the Nim
compiler compiles itself three times in this time period to ensure a stable result.
Incremental compilation may further reduce recompile times soon.]

Modern concepts like zero-overhead iterators, compile-time evaluation of user-defined
functions and cross-module inlining in combination with the preference of
value-based, stack-located data types leads to extremely efficient code.
Multi-threading, asynchronous input/output operations (async IO), parallel processing
and SIMD instructions including GPU execution are supported.  Various memory
management strategies exists: selectable and tuneable high performance
[.ndef]#Garbage Collectors# (GC), including a new fully deterministic destructor
based GC, are supported for automatic memory management. These can be disabled for
manual memory management.  This makes Nim a good choice for application development
and close-to-the-hardware system programming at the same time. The unrestricted
hardware access, small executables and optional GC will make Nim a perfect solution
for embedded systems, hardware driver and (OS) development.

=== Nim is Expressive and Elegant

Nim offers a modern type system with templates, generics and type inference. Built-in
advanced data types like dynamic containers, sets, and strings with full UTF support
are completed by a large collection of library types like hash tables and regular
expressions. While the traditional {oop} programming style with inheritance and dynamic dispatch is supported, Nim
does not enforce this programming paradigm and offers modern concepts like procedural
and functional programming. The powerful AST-based hygienic macro system offers
nearly unlimited possibilities for the advanced programmer. These macro and
meta-programming system allows compiler-guided code generation at compile time, so
the Nim core language can be kept small and compact, while many advanced features are
enabled by user defined macros. For example the support of asynchronous IO operations
has been created with these forms of meta-programming, as well as many Domain
Specific Language (DSL) extensions.

=== Nim is Open and Free

The Nim compiler and all of the standard library are implemented in Nim. All source
code is available under the less restricted MIT license.

=== Nim has a friendly and helpful growing community

The Nim forum is hosted at

https://forum.nim-lang.org/

and the software running the forum is coded in Nim.

Real-time chat is supported by IRC, Gitter and others.

=== Nim has a encouraging future

Started more than 12 years ago as a small community project of some bright CS
students led by [.ndef]#Mr. A. Rumpf#, it is now considered as one of the most
interesting and promising programming languages supported by uncounted individuals
and companies of leading computer industry, for instance in the areas of game, web
and crypto-currency development.  Nim has made large progress in the last few years:
it reached version 1.2 with some stability guaranties and a new deterministic memory
management system was introduced, which will improve support of parallel processing
and the use of Nim in the embedded area.

== Why is Nim not a popular mainstream language yet?

Nim was created by Mr. A. Rumpf in 2008, supported by a few volunteers. Finally in
2018 Nim got some significant monetary support by [.ndef]#Status Corp.# and in 2019
stable Nim version 1.0 was released. But still Nim is developed by a small core team
and some volunteers, while some other languages like Java, C#, Go or Rust are
supported by large companies, or like C and {cpp} have a very long history and
well-trained users. And finally there are many competing languages, some with a
longer history, and some maybe better suited for special purposes, like JavaScript,
Dart or Kotlin for web development, Julia or R for numeric applications, or C and
Assembly for the tiny 8-bit {uc}s with a small amount of RAM.

Nim is already supported by more than 1000 external packages which cover many
application areas, but that number is still small compared to really popular
languages like Python, Java or JavaScript. And some Nim packages can currently not
really compare with the libraries of other languages, which have been optimized for
years by hundreds or thousands of full-time developers.

Indeed the future of Nim is not really secure. Core developers may vanish, financial
support may stop, or maybe a better language may appear. But even if the development
of Nim should stop some day, you will still be able to use it, and many concepts that
you may have learned with Nim can be used with other modern languages too.

== Some Facts About Nim

* The generated executables are dependence free and small: a simple
chess program with a plain GTK-based graphical user interface is only 100 kB in size and
the size of the Nim compiler executable itself is about 5 MB. It is possible to shrink the executable
size of "Hello World" programs to about 10 kB for use on tiny {uc}s.

* Nim is fast. Generally performance is very close to other
high-performance languages such as C or C++. There are some exceptions still: other
languages may have libraries or applications that have been tuned for performance for many
years, while similar Nim applications are so far less tuned for performance, or maybe
are more written with a priority of short and clean code or run-time safety.

* Clean syntax with significant white-space, no need for block delimiters like
[.term]#{}# 
or [.term]#begin/end# keywords, and no need for statement delimiters like [.term]#;#

* Safety: Nim program are type- and memory-safe -- memory corruption is prevented by the
compiler as long as unsafe low level constructs like cast and the addr operator are not used.

* Fast compiler. The Nim compiler can compile itself and other medium-size packages
in less
than 10 seconds, and upcoming incremental compilation will increase that speed
further.

* Nim is statically typed: each object and each variable has a well-defined type,
which catches most programming errors already at compile time, prevents run-time
errors, and ensures highest performance.

* Nim supports various memory management strategies, including manually
allocations for critical low-level tasks as well as various garbage collectors
including a state-of-the-art, fully deterministic memory manager.

* Nim produces native, highly optimized executables and can also generate
JavaScript output for web applications.

* Nim has a clean module concept which helps to structure large projects.

* Nim has a well-designed library which supports many basic programming tasks.
The full source code of the library is included and can be viewed easily
from within the HTML-based API documentation.

* That library is supported by more than 1000 external packages for a broad range
of use cases.

* Asynchronous operation, threading and parallel processing is supported.

* Nim supports all popular operating systems like Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android.

* Usage of external libraries written in C is easy and and occurs directly
without any glue code, and Nim can even work together with code written in other
languages, for example there are some Nim +<->+ Python interfaces available.

* Many popular editors have support for Nim syntax highlighting and other
IDE functionality like on-the-fly checking for errors and displaying detailed
information about imported functions.

== Our first Nim Program

To keep our motivation, we will present a first tiny Nim program now. Actually we
should have delayed this section until we have installed the Nim compiler on our
computer, but we can already run and test the program by just copying it into one
of the available Nim online playgrounds like

https://play.nim-lang.org/

In the section <<What is an Algorithm?>> we described an algorithm to sum up the first 100 natural
numbers. Converting that algorithm into a Nim program is straightforward and results
in the text file below. You can copy it into the playground and run it now if you
want. The program is built using some elementary Nim instructions for which we will give
only a very short description here. Everything is explained in much more detail in the
next part of this book.

[source,nim]
----
var sum: int
var i: int
sum = 0
i = 0
while i < 100:
  inc(i, 1)
  inc(sum, i)
echo sum
----

We write Nim programs in the form of plain
text files, and you will learn how to create them soon. We call these
text files the [.ndef]#source code# of the program.  The source code is the input for the
compiler. The compiler processes the source code, checks it for obvious errors and
then generates an executable file, which contains the final CPU
instructions and can be run. Executable files are sometimes called executables
or binary files. The term binary is misleading, as all files on computers are indeed
stored as binary data, but the expression "binary" is used to differentiate
the executable program from text files like the Nim source code which we can
read, print and edit in an editor. Don't try to load the executable files generated by the Nim
compiler into a text editor, as the content is not plain text, but numeric machine code
that may confuse the editor. On the Windows OS, executable files generally get a special name extension
[.term]#.exe#, but on Linux no special name extensions are used.

Elementary entities of computer programs are
variables, which are basically named storage areas in the computer. As Nim is a
compiled and statically-typed language, we have to declare each variable before we
can use it. We do that by choosing a meaningful name for the variable and specifying
its data type. To tell the compiler about our intention to declare a variable, we
start the line with the [.term]#var# keyword, followed by the chosen name, a colon
and the data type of our variable. The first line of our program declares a new
variable named sum of data type int. Int is short for integer and indicates that our
variable should be able to store negative or positive integer numbers. The
[.key]#var# at the start of the line is a [ndef]#keyword#. Keywords are
reserved symbols which have a special meaning for the compiler. Var indicates
that we want to introduce a new variable.  The compiler will recognize that and will
reserve a memory location in the RAM of the computer which can store the actual value
of the variable.

The second line is nearly identical to the first line: we declare another variable
again with int type and plain name i. Variable names like i, j, k are often used when
we have no idea for a meaningful name and when we intend to use that variable as a
counter in a loop.

In the lines 3 and 4 of our program we initialize the variables, that is, we give them a
well-defined initial value. To do that we use the [.term]#=# operator to assign it a
value. Operators are special symbols like [.term]#+#, [.term]#-#, [.term]#*# or [.term]#/#
to indicate our desire to do an
addition, a subtraction, a multiplication or a division. Note that the [.term]#=#
operator is used in Nim like in many other programming languages for assignment, and
not like in traditional mathematics as an equality test. The reason for that is that in
computer programming, assignments occur more often than equality tests. Some early
languages like Pascal use the compound [.term]#:=# operator for assignment, which
may be closer to mathematics use, but is more difficult to type on a keyboard and
looks not too nice for most people. An expression like [.term]#x = y# assigns
//if you want to abbreviate "that is", you can use ie.  eg is the abbreviate of "for example",
//though many English readers do not know the difference!  -J
the content of variable y to x, that is, x gets the value of y, the former value of x
is overwritten and lost, and the content of y remains unchanged. After that assignment,
x and y contain the same value. In the above example we do not assign the content of
a variable to the destination, but instead use a literal numeric constant with value 0. When the computer
has executed lines 3 and 4 the variables sum and i each contain the start value 0.

Line 5 is much more interesting: it contains a [.key]#while# condition. The line
starts with the term [.key]#while#, which is again a reserved keyword, followed by
the logical expression [.term]#i < 100# and a colon. An expression in Nim is
something which has a result, like a math expression as [.term]#2 + 2# which has the
result 4 of type integer. A logical expression has no numerical result, but a
logical one, which can be [.term]#true# or [.term]#false#. The logical expression
[.term]#i < 100# depends on the actual content of variable [.term]#i#. The two lines
following the line with the [.term]#while# keyword are each indented by two spaces,
meaning that these lines start with two spaces more than the line before. That
form of indentation is used in Nim to indicate blocks. Blocks are grouped statements.
The complete while loop consists of the line containing the while keyword followed
by a block of statements. The block after the while condition is executed as long as
the [.key]#while# condition evaluates to true. For the first iteration [.term]#i#
has the initial value [.term]#0#, the condition [.term]#i < 100# evaluates to
[.term]#true# and the block after the [.term]#while# condition is executed for the
first time. In the following block we have the [.term]#inc()# instruction.
[.term]#inc# is short for increment. [.term]#inc(a, b)# increases the value of a by
b, b is unchanged. So in the above block [.term]#i# is increased by one, and after that [.term]#sum#
is increased by the current value of [.term]#i#. So when that block is executed for
the first time [.term]#i# has the value [.term]#1# and [.term]#sum# also has the
value [.term]#1#. At the end of that block execution starts again at the line with
the [.term]#while# condition, now testing the expression [.term]#i < 100# with
[.term]#i# containing the value [.term]#1#. Again it evaluates to [.term]#true#,
the block is executed again, [.term]#i# gets the new value [.term]#2#, and
[.term]#sum# gets the value [.term]#3#. This process continues until [.term]#i# has
the value [.term]#100#, so the condition [.term]#i < 100# evaluates to [.term]#false#
and execution proceeds with the first instruction after the [.term]#while# block.
That instruction is an [.term]#echo# statement, which is used in Nim to write values
to the terminal or screen of the computer. Some other languages use the term
[.term]#print# or [.term]#put# instead of [.term]#echo#.

Don't worry if you have not understood much of this short explanation, we will
explain all that in much more detail later.

== Binary Numbers

When we write numbers in ordinary life we generally use the decimal system with
base 10 and the
10 available digits 0, 1, ... 9.
To get the value of a decimal number we multiply each digit with powers of 10
depending on the position of the digit and sum the individual terms.
The rightmost digit is multiplied with 10^0, the next digit with 10^1, and so on.
A literal decimal number like 7382 has then the numerical
value [.term]#2 * 10^0 + 8 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^2 + 7 * 10^3#. We have used here the
exponential operator [.term]#^# -- with [.term]#10^3 = 10 * 10 * 10#. Current
computers use binary representation internally for numbers. Generally we do
not care much about that fact, but it is good to know some facts about binary
numbers. Binary numbers work nearly identically to decimal numbers.  The
distinction is that we have only two available digits, which we write as
[.term]#0# and [.term]#1#. A number in binary representation is a sequence of these
two digits. Like in the decimal system, the numerical value results from the
individual digits and their position: The binary number [.term]#1011# has the
numerical value [.term]#1 * 2^0 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^3#, which is 11 in decimal
notation. For binary numbers the base is 2, so we multiply the binary digits
by powers of two.
Formally addition of two binary numbers works like we know it from the decimal
system: we add the matching digits and take carry into account: [.term]#1001 + 1101 = 10110#
because we start by adding the two least significant digits of each number, which are
both 1. That addition 1+1 results in a carry and result 0. The next two digits are
both zero, but we have to take the carry from the former operation into account, so
result is 1. For the next position we have to add 0 and 1, which is just 1 without a
carry. And finally we have 1 + 1, which results in 0 with a carry. The carry
generates one more digit, and we are done. In the decimal system with base 10 a
multiplication with 10 is easily calculated by just shifting all digits one place to
the left and writing a 0 at the now empty rightmost position. For binary numbers it
is very similar: a multiplication by the base, which is two in the binary system,
is just a shift left, with the rightmost position getting digit 0.footnote:[If you still
wonder why this works that way in decimal and binary system: Remember how we determine the value
of a literal number. We sum the digits multiplied with powers of the base. And if we multiply
an arbitrary number with the base, each of these powers increases obviously by one. Write it on a piece of paper
when it is not yet clear to you.]

In the binary system we call the digits often [.ndef]#bits#, and we number the bits from right
to left, starting with 0 for the rightmost bit -- we say that the binary number
10010101 is an 8-bit number because writing that number in binary representation needs
8 digits. Often we imagine the individual bits as small bulbs, a 1 bit is imagined as a
lit bulb, and a 0 bit is imagined as a dark bulb. For lit bulbs we say also that the
bit is set, meaning that in the binary number 10010101, bits 0, 2, 4 and 7 are set, and the
other bits are unset or cleared.

Groups of 8 bits are called a [.ndef]#byte#, and sometimes 4 bits are
called a [.ndef]#nibble#.

One, two, four or 8 bytes are sometimes called a [.ndef]#word#, where a word is an entity
which the computer can process in one single instruction. When we have a CPU with 8
byte word size this means that the computer can for example add two variables, each 8
byte in size, in one single instruction.

Let us investigate some basic properties of binary numbers. Let us assume that we have
an 8-bit word (a byte). An 8-bit word can have 2^8 different states, as each bit can be set or
unset independently from the other bits. That corresponds to numbers 0 up to 255 --
we assume that we work with positive numbers only for now, we will come to negative
numbers soon. An important property of binary numbers in computers is the wrapping around, which
is a consequence of the fact that we have only a limited set of bits available to store the
number. So when we continuously add 1 to a number, at some point all bits are set,
which corresponds to the largest number that can be stored with that number of bits.
When we then add again 1, we get an overflow. The run-time system may catch that
overflow, so we get an overflow error, or the number is just reset to zero, as it may
happen in our car when we manage to drive one million miles, or when the ordinary
clock jumps from 23:59 to 00:00 of the next day. An useful property of binary numbers
is the fact that we can easily invert all bits, that is replace set bits by unset
ones and vice versa. Let us use the prefix [.term]#!# to indicate the operation of
bit inversion, then [.term]#!01001100# is [.term]#10110011#. It is an obvious and
useful fact that for each number x we get a number with all bits set when we add x
and !x. That is [.term]#x + !x = 11111111# when we consider a 8 bit word. And when we
ignore overflow, then it follows that [.term]#x + !x + 1 = 0# for each number x. That
is a useful property, which we can use when we consider negative numbers.

Now let us investigate how we can encode negative numbers in binary form. In the
binary representation we have only two states available, 0 or 1, a set bit or an
//may is usually used for permission: May I go?  Could/can is used for alternate possibilities
unset bit. But we have no unitary minus sign. We could encode the sign of a number
in the topmost bit of a word -- when the topmost bit is set that indicates that the
number is regarded negative. Generally a modified version of this encoding is used,
called [.ndef]#{twocom}#: a negative number is constructed by first inverting all the
bits -- a 0 bit is transferred into a 1 bit and vice versa -- and finally the number 1
is added. That encoding simplifies the CPU construction, as subtraction can be replaced by
addition in this way:

Consider the case that we want to do a subtraction of two binary encoded numbers.  The
operation has the symbolic notation A - B for arbitrary numbers A and B. The
subtraction is by definition the inverse operation of the addition, that is A + B - B
= A for each number A and B, or in other words, B - B = 0 for each number B.

Assume we have a CPU that can do additions and that can invert all the bits of a
number. Can we do subtraction with that CPU? Indeed we can. Remember the fact that
for each number X [.term]#X + !X + 1 = 0# as long as we ignore overflow. If that
relation is true for each number, than it is obviously true for each B in the
expression A - B, and we can write A - B = A + (B + !B + 1) - B = A + (!B + 1) when
we use the fact that in mathematics addition and subtraction is associative, that is
we can group the terms as we want. But the term in the parenthesis is just the
{twocom}, which we get when we invert all bits of B and add 1. So to do a
subtraction we have to invert the bits of B, and then add A and !B and 1 ignoring
overflow. That may sound complicated, but bit inversion is a very cheap operation in
a CPU, which is always available, and adding 1 is also a very simple operation. The
advantage is that we do not need separate hardware for the subtraction operation.
Generally subtraction in this way is not slower than addition because the bit
inversion and the addition of 1 can be performed at the same time in the CPU as an
ordinary addition.

From the equation above indicating A - B = A + (!B + 1) it is obvious that we
consider the {twocom} (!B + 1) as the negative of B. Note that the
{twocom} of zero is again zero, and {twocom} of 00000001 is 11111111. All
negative numbers in this system have a bit set to 1 at the leftmost position. This
restrict all positive numbers to all the bit combinations where the leftmost bit is
unset. For an 8-bit word this means that positive numbers are restricted to the bits
00000000 to 01111111, which is the range 0 to 127 in decimal notation. The {twocom}
of decimal 127 is 10000001. Seems to be fine so far, but note there exists also the
bit pattern 10000000 which is -128 in decimal.
For that bit pattern there exists no positive value.  If we try to build the
{twocom} of that bit pattern, we would get the same pattern again.
This is an asymmetry of
{twocom} representation, which can not be avoided. It generally is no problem,
with one exception. We can never invert the sign of the smallest available integer;
that operation would result in a run-time error.footnote:[If you have a piece of
paper and a pencil at hand, you may test some properties of signed binary numbers
represented in {twocom}: take binary 0, apply the {twocom} operation
to get the negative of it. Note, we ignore overflow here when we add the 1! That was
easy. Can we verify that all negative numbers in {twocom} can really be
identified by its set topmost bit? Maybe that fact is not really obvious, as we not
only invert all bits of the positive number, but also add 1. OK, let us consider
the non-negative numbers 0 .. 127 for an 8-bit word. All those bit patterns have the topmost bit
cleared and all bit combinations used in the other 7 bits. Inverting these patterns
gives us a pattern with the leftmost bit set and again all bit combinations used in the other 7 bits.
Fine so far, the topmost bit is set, but we still have to add 1 to complete
our {twocom} operation. But the only case where adding 1 changes the topmost
bit is when the 7 other bits are all set, and that is only the case when the initial
value before bit inversion was zero. So the leftmost bit remains set for all
numbers except initial zero, and zero maps to zero again!]

Summary: when we work only with positive numbers, we can store in an 8-bit word,
which is generally called a byte, numbers from 0 up to 255. In a 16-bit word we could
store values from 0 up to 2^16 - 1, which is 65535. When we need numbers which can be
also negative we have for 8-bit words the range from -128 to 127 available, which is
-2^7 up to 2^7 - 1. For a signed 16-bit word the range would be -2^15 up to 2^15 - 1.

While we can work with 8 or 16-bit words, for PC programming the CPU usually supports
32 or 64 bit words, so we have a much larger number range available. But
when we program {uc}s or embedded devices we may indeed have only 8 or 16-bits words
available, or we may use such small words size intentionally on a PC to fit all of our data
into a smaller memory area.

One important note at the end of this section: whenever we have a word with a
specific bit pattern stored in the memory of our computer, then we can not decide
from the bit pattern directly what type of data it is. It can be a positive or a
negative number, but maybe it is not a number at all but a letter or maybe
something totally different. As an example consider this 8 bit word: 10000001. It could
be 129 if we have stored intentionally positive numbers in that storage location, or
could be -127 if we intentionally stored a negative value. Or it could be not a
number at all. Is that a problem? No it is not as long as we use a programming
language like Nim which use static typing. Whenever we are using variables we
declare their type first, and so the compiler can do bookkeeping about the type of
each variable stored in the computer memory. The benefit is, that we can
use all the available bits to encode our actual data, and we do not have to reserve a few
bits to encode the actual data type of variables. For languages without static
typing that is not the case.  In languages like Python or Ruby we can use variables
without a static type, so we can assign whatever we want to it. That seems to be
comfortable at first, but can be confusing when we write larger programs and the
Python or Ruby interpreter has to do all the bookkeeping at run-time, which is slow
and wastes memory for the bookkeeping.

To say it again in other words: for deciding if an operation is valid, it is
generally sufficient to know the data type of the operands only. We do not have to know the
actual content. The only exception is if we invert the sign of the most negative integer number
or if we do an operation with causes an overflow, as there are not enough bits available
to store the result -- we may get a run-time error for that case.footnote:[For the
current Nim implementation, signed overflow generates an overflow exception, while
unsigned types just wrap around. For C it is similar -- for C99 it is defined that
unsigned int types wrap around, while the behavior for signed ints is undefined and
depends on the actual implementation of the C compiler.]  
In a statically-typed language each variable has a well-defined type,
and the compiler can ensure at compile time that all operations on that variables are
valid. If an operation is not valid then the compiler will give an error message.
Then when these operations are executed at run-time they are always valid operations,
and the actual content, like the actual numeric value, does not matter.

== Hexadecimal Numbers

These number type with base 16 is by far not that important than the binary numbers,
and it has not really a technical justification to exist, but you may get in touch with these
numbers from time to time. Hexadecimal numbers are mostly a legacy from early
days of computers, where computer programming was done not in real programming
languages but with numeric codes. To represent the 16 hexadecimal digits the 10
decimal digits are supported by the characters 'A' .. 'F'. The most important property of a 
decimal digit is that it can represent four bits, a unit halve of a byte which is called sometimes a nibble.
In old times when it was necessary to type in binary numbers it was sometimes easier to
encode a nibble with a hexadecimal digit:

The only location where we hear about hexadecimal characters again in this book should be when we
introduce the character and string data types -- there control characters like a newline character
are sometimes specified in hexadecimal form like "\x0A" for a newline character.

== Installation of the Compiler

We will not describe in too much detail how you can install the Nim compiler, because that
strongly depends on your operating system, and because the install instructions may
change in the future. We assume that you have a computer with an installed operating
system and internet access, and you are able to do at least very basic operations
with your computer, such as switching it on, log in and  and opening a web browser or a terminal
window. If that is not the case then you really should ask someone for help for this
basic step, and maybe for some more help for other basic tasks.

Detailed installation instructions are available on the Nim internet homepage at
https://nim-lang.org/install.html.footnote:[To visit and read that page, you
have to enter this string in the address input field of your internet browser.]  Try to follow those instructions, and when they are
not sufficient, then please ask at the Nim forum for help:
https://forum.nim-lang.org/

If you are using a Linux operating system, then your system generally provides a
package manager, which should make the installation very easy.

For example for a Gentoo Linux system you would open a root terminal and simple type
"emerge -av nim". That command would install Nim including all necessary dependencies
for you. It may take a few minutes as Gentoo compiles all packages fresh from
source code, but then you are done. Similar commands exist for most other
Linux distributions.

Another solution, which is preferable when you want to ensure that you get the most
recent Nim compiler, is compiling directly from the latest git sources. That process is
also easy and is described here: https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim. But before you can
follow those instructions you have to ensure that the git software
and a working C compiler is available on your computer. 

== Creation of Source Code Files

Nim source code, as most source code of other programming languages, is based on text
files. Text files are documents saved on your computer that contain only ordinary
letters which you can type on your keyboard. No images or videos, no HTML content
with fancy CSS styling. Generally source code should contain only ordinary ASCII
text, that is no umlauts or unicode characters.

To create source code we generally use a text editor, which is a tool designed for
creating and modifying of plain text files. If you do not have a text editor yet
you may also use a word processor for writing some source code, but then you have to
ensure that the file is finally saved as plain ASCII text. Editors generally support
syntax highlighting, that is keywords, numbers and such are displayed with a unique
color or style to make it easier to recognize the content. Some editors support
advanced features like checking for errors while you type the program source code.

A list of recommended editors is available at https://nim-lang.org/faq.html

If you do not want to use a special editor now, then for Linux gedit or at least [.term]#nano#
should be available. For Windows maybe something like notepad.

Generally we store our Nim source code files in its own directory, that is a separate section
of your hard-disk. If you work on Linux in a terminal window, then you can type

----
cd
mkdir mynimfiles
cd mynimfiles
gedit test.nim
----

You type these commands in the terminal window and press the [.term]#return# key
after each of the above lines -- that is you type [.term]#cd# on your keyboard and then press the
[.term]#return# key to execute that command. The same for the next three commands.
What you have done is this: you go to your default working area (home directory),
then create a subarea named mynimfiles, then you go into that subarea and finally you
launch the gedit editor -- the argument test.nim tells gedit that you want to create
a new file called test.nim. If gedit is not available, or if you work on a computer
without a graphical user interface, then you may replace the gedit command by nano.
While gedit opens a new window with a graphical interface, nano opens only a very
simple interface in the current terminal. An interesting editor without a
GUI is vim or neovim. That is a very powerful editor, but it is difficult to learn and it is a bit
strange as you have a command mode and an ordinary text input mode available.
For neovim there is very good Nim support available.

If you do not want to work from a terminal, or if you are using Windows or MAC OS,
then you should have a graphical user interface which enables you also to create a
directory and to launch an editor.

When the editor is opened, you can type in the Nim source code from our previous
example and save it to a file named test.nim. Then you can terminate the editor.

Note that the [.term]#return# key behaves differently in editors than in the terminal window:
In the terminal window you type in a command and finally press the return key to
"launch" or execute the command. In an editor the return key is not that special:
if you press ordinary keys in your editor, than that key is inserted and the cursor
moves one position to the right. And when you press the return key then an
invisible newline character is inserted and the cursor moves to the start
of the next line.

== Launching the compiler and running the program

If you are working from a Linux terminal then you can type

----
ls -lt
cat test.nim
----

That is you first show the content of your directory with the ls command and then display the content
of the Nim source code file that you just have typed in with the cat command.

Now type

----
nim c test.nim
----

That invokes the Nim compiler and instructs it to compile your source code.
The "c" letter is called an option, it tells the Nim compiler to compile your
program and to use the C backend to generate an executable.

The compiler should display nearly immediately a success message. If it displays
some error messages instead, then you launch gedit or nano again, fix your typing
error, save the modified file and call the compiler again.

Finally, when the source text is successfully compiled, you can run your program by
typing

----
./test
----

In your terminal window you see a number now, which is the sum of the numbers 1 to
100. 

****
You may wonder why you have to type the prefix [.term]#./# in front of the name of your
generated executable program, as you can launch most other executables on your computer
without such a prefix. The prefix is generally needed to protect you and your
computer from  erroneously launching a program in the current directory
while you intended to launch a system command. Imagine you downloaded a zip
file from internet, extract it, cd into the extracted directory and type [.term]#ls# to
see the directory content. Imagine now that the directory contains an executable named ls
which is executed instead of system [.term]#ls#. That foreign ls command may damage your system.
So to execute non system commands, you generally have to use the prefix [.term]#./# where
the period refers to the current directory. Of course you can install your own
programs in a way that you don't need such a prefix any more -- just ask your Mom or Grandma
if you don't know yourself already.
****

If you have not managed to open a terminal where you can invoke the compiler -- well
maybe then you should install some of the advanced editors like VS-Code. They should
be able to launch the compiler and run the program from within the editor directly.

The command

----
nim c test.nim
----

is the most basic compiler invocation. The extension .nim is optional, the compiler can infer that option.
This command compiles our program in default debug mode, it
uses the C compiler back end and generates a native executable. Debug mode means, that the
generated executable contains a lot of checks, like array index checks, range checks,
nil dereference checks and many more. The generated executable will run not very fast and it will
be large, but when your program has bugs then the program will give you a meaningful
error message in most cases. Only after you have tested your program carefully you may
consider compiling it without debug mode. You may do that with

----
nim c -d:release test.nim

nim c -d:danger test.nim
----

The compiler option -d:release removes most checks and debugging code and enables the backend optimization
by passing the option "-O3" to the C compiler backend,
giving a very fast and small executable file.
The option -d:danger removes all checks, it includes -d:release. You should be aware that
compiling with -d:danger means that your program may crash without any useful information, or even bad,
may run, but contain uncatched errors like overflows and so may give you wrong results. Generally you
should compile your program with plain [.term]#nim c# first. When you have tested it well and you may need the
additional performance, you may switch to -d:release option. For games, benchmarks or other uncritical stuff you may
try -d:danger.

There exists many more compiler options, you can find them explained in the Nim manual or you may
use the command nim --help and nim --fullhelp to get them displayed. One important new option is --gc:arc
to enable the new deterministic memory management. You may combine --gc:arc with -d:useMalloc to disable
Nims own memory allocator, this reduces the executable size and enables the use of Valgrind
to detect memory leaks. Similar to --gc:arc is the option --gc:orc which can deal with cyclic data structures.
Finally a very powerful option is --passC:-flto. This option is for the C compiler backend and enables link
time optimization (LTO). LTO enables inlining for all procedure calls and can significantly reduce
the final program size. We should mention that you can also try the C++ compiler backend with the
cpp command instead of plain c command, and that you may compile with clang backend instead of default gcc
backend with the --cc:clang option. You can additional specify the option -r to immediately run the program
after successful build. For testing small scripts the compiler invocation in the form "nim r myfile.nim" can be used
to compile and run a program without generation of a permanent executable file.
Here is an example how we use all these options:

----
nim c -d:release --gc:arc -d:useMalloc --passC:-flto --passC:-march=native board.nim
----

In this example we additional pass -march=native to the C compiler backend
to enable use of the most efficient CPU instructions of our computer, which may
result in an executable that will not run on older hardware. Of course we can save all these
parameters in configuration files, so that we don't have to actual type then for each compiler invocation.
You may find more explanations to all the compiler options in the Nim manual
or in later sections of this book, this includes the options for the JavaScript backend. 

= Part II: The Basics

In this part we will introduce the most important constructs of the Nim programming language,
like statements and expression, conditional and repeated execution, functions and
procedures, iterators, templates, exceptions and we will discuss various basic data types
including the basic container types array, sequence and string.

== Declarations

We can declare constants, variables, procedures or our custom data types. Declarations are used
to give information to the compiler, for example about the type of a variable that we
intend to use.

We will explain type and procedure declarations in later sections. Currently only constant and
variable declarations are important.

A constant declaration in its simplest form maps a symbolic name to a value, like

[source, nim]
----
const Pi = 3.1415
----

We use the reserved word [.key]#const# to tell the compiler that we want to declare
a constant which we have named Pi and we assign it the numeric decimal value 3.1415. Nim has
a small set of reserved words like [.key]#var, const, proc, while# and others, to
tell the compiler that we want to declare a variable, a constant, a procedure or that
we want to use a while loop for some repeated execution. The [.op]#=# is the
assignment operator in Nim, it assigns the value or expression on the right side of
it to the symbol on the left. You have to understand that it is different from the
equal sign we may use in mathematics. Some languages like Pascal initially used
the compound operator [.term]#:=# for assignments, but that is not easy to type on
the keyboard and looks a bit angry for sensible people. And source code usually
contains a lot of assignments, so use of [.op]#=# makes some sense. We
call [.op]#=# an operator. Operators are symbols which perform some basic
operation, like [.op]#+# for the addition of two numbers, or [.op]#=# for the
assignment of a value to a symbol. 
With the above constant declaration we can use the symbol [.term]#Pi# in our program's source code and
don't have to remember or retype the exact sequence of digits.
Using named constants like our Pi above makes it easy to modify the value -- if we notice that we need more 
precision, we can look up the exact value of Pi and change the constant at one place in our source code, we don't
have to search for the digit sequence 3.14 in all our source code files.
 
For numeric constants like our Pi value the compiler will
do a substitution in the source code when the program is compiled, so where we
write the symbol [.term]#Pi# the actual numeric value is used.

For constant declarations it must be possible to determine its value at compile time.
Expressions assigned to constants can contain simple operations like basic math, but
some functions calls may be not allowed.

Variable declarations are more complicated, as we ask the compiler to reserve a named
storage location for us:

[source, nim]
----
var velocity: int
----

Here we put the reserved keyword [.key]#var# at the beginning of the line to tell the
compiler that we want to declare a variable, then we give our chosen name for that
variable followed by a colon and the data type of the variable. The int type is a
predefined numeric type indicating a signed integer type. The storage capacity of an
integer variable depends on the operating system of your computer. On 32-bit systems
32 bits are used, and on 64-bit systems 64 bits are used to store one single integer variable.
That is enough for even
large signed integer numbers: the range is -2^31 up to 2^31 - 1 for 32 bit systems and
-2^63 up to 2^63 - 1 for 64-bit systems.

For variables we generally use lower case names, but names of constants
may start with an upper case letter.

== Statements

Statements or instructions are a core component of Nim programs: they tell the
computer what it shall do. Often statements are procedure calls, like the
call of the [.term]#echo()# or [.term]#inc()# procedure which we have already seen in part I of the book.
What procedures exactly are we will learn in later sections. For now we just regard
procedures as entities that perform a well defined task for us when we call them. We
call them by writing their name in our source file, optionally followed by a list of
parameters, also called arguments. When we write [.term]#echo 7# then echo is the procedure which we
call, and 7 is the argument, an integer literal in this case. The effect of our
procedure call is that the decimal number 7 is written to the terminal when we run
the program after compilation. A special form of procedures are functions, that are
procedures that can return a value or result. In mathematics, sin() or cos() would be
functions -- we pass an angle as argument and get the sine or cosine as a result.

Let's look at this minimal Nim program:

[source, nim]
----
var a: int
a = 2 + 3
echo a
----

The Nim program above consists of a variable declaration and two statements: in the
first line we declare the variable we want to use. In the next line we assign
the value [.term]#2 + 3# to it, and finally in line 3 we use the procedure [.term]#echo()# to display the
content of our variable in the terminal window.

Nim programs are generally processed from top to bottom by the compiler, and when we
execute the program after successful compilation, then it also executes from top to
button. A consequence of this is that we have to write the lines of above program
exactly in that order. If we moved the variable declaration down, then the
compiler would complain about an undeclared variable because the variable is 
used before it has been declared. If we exchanged lines 2 and 3, then the
compiler would be still satisfied, and we would be able to compile and run the
program. But we would get a very different result, because we would first try to
display the value of variable a, and later assign a value to it.

When we have to declare multiple constants or variables, then we can use a block,
that is we write the keyword var or const on its own line, followed by the
actual declarations like in

[source, nim]
----
const
  Pi = 3.1415
  Year = 2020
var
  sum: int
  age: int
----

Note the indentation -- the lines after const and var start with some space
characters, so they build a block which allows the compiler to detect where the
declaration ends. Generally we use two spaces for each level of indentation.
Other numbers would work also, but the indentation scheme should be consistent. Two
spaces is the general recommendation, as it is clearly recognizable for humans in the
source code, and because it doesn't waste too much space, that is, it would not generate
long lines which may not fit onto the screen.

Also note that in Nim we generally write each statement onto its own line. The line
break indicates to the compiler that the statement has ended. There are a few
exceptions -- long mathematical expressions can continue on the next line (see the
Nim manual for details). We can also put multiple statements on a single line when we
separate them by a semicolon.

We can also declare multiple variables of the same type in one single declaration, like

[source, nim]
----
var
  sum, age: int
----

or we can assign an initial start value to a variable like in

[source, nim]
----
var
  year: int = 1900
----

Finally, for variable declarations we can use type inference when we assign an initial
start value, that is we can write

[source, nim]
----
var
  year = 1900
----

The compiler recognizes in this case that we assign an integer literal to that
variable and so silently gives the variable the int type for us. Type inference can be
comfortable, but may make it harder for readers to understand the code, or the type
inference may not always do exactly what we want. For example in the above code year
gets the type int, which is a signed 4 or 8 byte number. But maybe we would prefer an
unsigned number, or a number which occupies only two bytes in memory. So use
type inference with some caution.

Note: For integral data we mostly use the int data type in Nim, which is a signed
type with 4 or 8-byte size. It usually does not make sense to use many different
integral types -- signed, unsigned, and types of different byte size. Mixing
them in numerical expressions can be confusing and maybe even decrease performance,
because the computer may have to do type conversion before it can do the math
operation. For unsigned types, another problem is that math operations on unsigned
operands could have a negative result. Consider the following example where we
use a hypothetical data type "unsigned int" to indicate unsigned integers:

[source, nim]
----
var a, b: unsigned int
a = 3
b = 7
a = a - b
----

The true result would be -4, but a is of unsigned type and can never contain a
negative content. So what should happen -- an incorrect result or a program termination?

Related to variable declarations is the initial start value of variables. Nim clears
for us all the bits of our variables when we declare them, that is, numbers get always
the initial start value zero if we do not assign a different value in the variable declaration.

In this declaration

[source, nim]
----
var
  a: int = 0
  b: int
----

both variables get the initial value zero.

There exists a variant for variable declarations which uses the [.key]#let# keyword instead
of the var keyword. Let is used when we need a variable which only once gets a value
assigned, while var is used when we want to change the content of the variable during
program execution. Let seems to be similar to const, but in const declarations we can
use only values that are known at compile time. Let allows us to assign to variables values
that are only available at program run time, maybe because the value is a
result of a prior calculation. But let indicates at the same time that the assignment
occurs only once, the content does not change later.
We say that the variable is immutable.
Use of the let keyword may help the human reader
of the source code understanding what in going on, and it may also help the compiler
doing optimizations to get faster or more compact code. For now we can just ignore
let declarations and use var instead -- later we may use let where appropriate, and the
compiler will tell us when let will not work and we have to use var.

****
The way how we declare constants, variables, types and procedures in Nim is very similar
as it was done in the wirthian languages Pascal, Modula and Oberon. People coming from
languages like C argue sometimes that C uses a shorter and better variable declaration
of the form [.term]#int velocity;# instead Nim's [.term]#var velocity: int#.
Indeed that declaration is shorter in this case. And some people like it better that the
data type is written first, they consider the data type more important than the name of the variable.
That is a matter of taste, and the C notation would not work well for var/let/const distinction and for
type declarations.
****

With what we have learned in this section we can rewrite our initial Nim
example from part I in this form:

[source,nim]
----
const
  Max = 100
var
  sum, i: int
while i < Max:
  inc(i)
  inc(sum, i)
echo sum
----

In the code above we declare both variables of type int in a single line and
take advantage of the fact that the compiler will initialize them with 0 for us.
And we use a named constant for the upper loop boundary. Another
tiny fix is that we write [.term]#inc(i)# instead of [.term]#inc(i, 1)#. We can do that
because there exists multiple procedures with the name [.term]#inc()# -- one
which takes two arguments, and one which takes only one argument and
always increases that argument by one. Instead of [.term]#inc(i)# we could have
written also [.term]#i = i + 1# and instead of [.term]#inc(sum, i)# we could write [.term]#sum = sum + i#.
That would generate identical code in the executable, so we can use whatever
we like better.

== Input and Output

We have already used the echo() procedure for displaying output in the terminal window. For
our experiments we may want to have some user input also. As we do not know much
about procedures currently, let us keep things simple for now and read in a textual user
input from the terminal window.
We use a procedure with name [.term]#readLine()# for this task.

[source,nim]
----
echo "enter some text"
var mytext = readLine(stdin)
echo "you entered:", mytext
----

Note that you have to press the [.term]#return# key after you have entered your text.

The
first line of our program is not really necessary; we just print some message. In the
second line we use the [.term]#readLine()# procedure to read textual user input. The
readLine() procedure needs one parameter to know from where it should read -- from the
terminal window or from a file for example. The [.term]#stdin# parameter indicates that it should read
from the current terminal window -- stdin is a global variable of the system (io) module and
indicates the standard input stream. Finally in line 3 we use again the [.term]#echo()# procedure to
print some text. In this case we pass two arguments to [.term]#echo()#, a literal text
enclosed in quotes, and then separated by a comma, the [.term]#mytext# variable. The
[.term]#mytext# variable has the data type [.term]#string#. We used type inference in
this example to declare that type: the [.term]#readLine()# procedure always returns a
[.term]#string#, the compiler knows that, so our [.term]#mytext# variable is
automatically declared with type [.term]#string#. We will learn more about data type
[.term]#string# and other useful predefined data types in the next section.

****
Nim supports the [.ndef]#method call syntax#, which was earlier called
[.ndef]#Uniform Function Call Syntax# in the D language. With that syntax we can
write procedure calls in the form a.f instead of f(a). We will discuss that syntax in
more detail when we explain {profus}. For now it is enough that you know
about the existence of that syntax, as we may use it at some places in the following
sections. For example for the length of text strings we generally write myTextString.len
instead of len(myTextString). Both notations are fully equivalent.
****

== Data types

=== Integer types

We have already used the [.term]#int# data type, which indicates a signed integer
type of 4 or 8-byte size, depending on the {os}. The reason the type depends on the
word size of the OS will become clear later when we explain what references and
pointers are.

Beside the int data type, Nim has some more data types for signed and unsigned
integers: [.term]#int8#, [.term]#int16#, [.term]#int32# and [.term]#int64# are signed
types with well-defined bit and byte size, and [.term]#uint8#, [.term]#uint16#,
[.term]#uint32# and [.term]#uint64# are the unsigned equivalents. The number at the
end of the type name is the bit size; we get the byte size when we divide that value
by 8. Additional we have the type [.term]#uint#, which corresponds to [.term]#int#
and has same size, but stores unsigned numbers only. footnote:[When we are using the
term "size" here, this means how much space the type needs in the RAM of the
computer. A type of size 4 would occupy 4 bytes of the RAM of your computer.] Generaly
we should try to use the int type for all integral numbers, but sometimes it can make
sense to use the other types. For example, when you have to work with a large
collection of numbers, you know that each number is not very big, and your RAM is not
really that large, then you may decide for example to use [.term]#int16# for all your
numbers. Or when you know that your numbers will be really big and will not fit in a
4 byte integer, then you may use the [.term]#int64# type to ensure that the numbers
fit in that type even when your program is compiled and executed on a computer with a
32 bit OS.

For integer numbers we have the predefined operators [.op]#+#, [.op]#-# and [.op]#*# available for
addition, subtraction and multiplication. Basically these operations works as we
may expect, but we have to remember that we may get overflows. For signed ints we
get compile- or run-time errors in that case, while unsigned ints just wrap around, see
example at the end of this section. For division of integers we have the operators
[.op]#div#, [.op]#mod#, and [.op]#/# available. The [.op]#div# operator does an integer division ignoring the remainder, [.op]#mod# is
short for modulus and gives us the remainder of the division, and [.op]#/# finally is currently
only predefined for the signed int type and gives us a fractional result of data type float.
That type is introduced in the next section.

Remembering how [.op]#div# and [.op]#mod# behaves when the divisor or dividend are negative
can be confusing, and it may differ for other programming languages. You
may find a detailed justified explanation in the Nim manual and at Wikipedia.

----

When performance matters we generally should try to use the "CPU native" number type
what for Nim is the int type. And we should try to avoid using math expressions with
different types, as the CPU may have to do type conversion in that case before the
math operation can be applied.  Adding two int8 types can on some CPU's be slower
then adding two ints, because the CPU may have to size extend the operands before the
math operation is performed. But this depends on the actual CPU, and there are
important exceptions: Multiplying two ints would result in an int128 result if int
size is 64 bit, which can be slow when the CPU does not support that operation well.
Another important point to consider for maximum performance is the cache usage. If
you are performing operations on a large set of data, then you may get a significant
performance gain when large fractions of your data fits in the caches of your
computer, as cache access is much faster than ordinary RAM access. So using smaller
data types, i.e.  int32 instead Nim's default int which is int64 on a 64 bit OS  may
increase performance in this special application.

When we use Nim on tiny {uc}s, maybe even on 8-bit controllers like the popular AVR
devices, it may be best to use only integers of well defined size like int8.

An important property of the current Nim implementation of A. Rumpf used with the C backend is the
fact that unsigned integers does not generate overflow errors but simple wrap around:

[source, nim]
----
var x: int8 = 0

while true:
  inc(x)
  echo x
----

Above code would print the numbers 0 up to 127 and then terminate program execution
due to an overflow error. But when we change the data type to uint8 we would get a
continues sequence of the numbers 0 up to 255. After the value 255 is reached, the
value wraps around to 0 again and the process continues.  This behavior can lead to
strange bugs and is the reason that the Nim team generally recommends to avoid
unsigned integers.

For compatibility with external libraries Nim has also the integer types cint and cuint,
which exactly match the C types int and uint when we compile for the C or {cpp}
backend. For the javascript backend, the LLVM backend or other backends these types may be
also avalable, for details you should consult the compiler documentation.
For most {os} and C compilers the int and
uint types in C are 4 bytes in size, but there can be exceptions, so we better should not
write code that depends on the actual byte size of the types. The Nim types cint and cuint are generally
only used for parameter lists of (C) library functions. To match other integer types
like C char, short, long, longlong Nim supports these types when we put a c letter in front
of the name like clong. Again you should consult the Nim compiler manual when you need
more details, ie. when you create bindings to external libraries.   

=== Floating point types

Another important numeric data type is float, for floating point numbers.  Floats are
an approximation of real numbers.  They can also store fractions, and are most often
printed in the decimal system with a decimal point, or in scientific notation with an
exponent. Examples for floats are

[source, nim]
----
var
  mean = 3.0 / 7.9
  x: float = 12
  y = 1.2E3
----

The variable mean is the result of a float division. If we printed the result
there would be a decimal point and some digits following it. For variable x we specify
the float type explicitly and assign the value 12. We could use type inference
if we assigned 12.0, because the compiler can recognize by the decimal point that
we want a float, not an int. In line 3 we use scientific notation for the float
literal that we assign to y, and the value is [.term]#1.2 * 10^3 = 1200.0#. Literal
values like [.term]#2E3# are also valid float literals -- the value would be
[.term]#2000.0#. But literals with a decimal point and no digits before or after the
point -- 1. or .2 -- are not valid.

In the current Nim implementation float variables occupy 64 bits. Nim has also the data type float64 which is
currently identical to plain float and float32 which can store only smaller numbers and has
less precision.footnote:[The fact that in the current Nim imprementation of A. Rumpf float is identical
to float64 should be seen as an implementation detail. For other implementations the float size may depend on OS and CPU.]
Floats can store values up to a magnitude of approximately
[.term]#1E308# with a positive or negative sign, and floats have a typical precision
of 16 digits.  That is, when you do a division of two arbitrary floats and print the
result, you will get up to 16 valid digits.

Generally we use floats whenever integers are not sufficient for some reason.  For
example when we have to do complicated mathematical operations which include
fractional operands like Pi, or when we have to do divisions and need the exact
fractional value.

The float, float32 and float64 data types provides the [.op]#+#, [.op]#-#, [.op]#*# and [.op]#\#
operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Unlike for the int types, for
the float types we get never overflow or underflow errors, and also no error for a division by zero.
But the result of an operation of two float operands can be a special value like
system.Inf, system.NegInf or system.NaN. The first two indicate an over- or underflow, and 
NaN indicates that the result of an operation is not a valid number at all, for example
the result of a division by zero or the result of calculating the square root of a negative
number. This behaviour is sometimes called saturated arithmetic. When a variable has
one of these special values, and we apply further math operations, then this value
is kept. So we can detect at the end of a longer mathematical calculation if
something went wrong -- we have not to check after each single operation.footnote:[
Well to some degree --  Inf + 1.0 is still Inf, but for Inf / Inf the result is not that obvious...]

Two important properties of floats are that not all numbers can be represented exactly and
that math operations are not absolutely accurate. When you do an addition like 1.0 +
2.0, the result will not be exactly 3.0, and 1.0 + 2.0 - 3.0 will not be exactly zero,
but a tiny floating point number. Maybe in the case when you use the above literal
values the compiler may be able to recognize the expression and deliver the exact
value, but when you assign the literals to variables and then do the math, you can be
sure that it is not absolutely accurate. That is no real problem: the accuracy is in
most cases much better than needed. But you should know about the minimal numeric
errors and should avoid testing two floats for exact equality, because they may not
be equal due to rounding errors, even when in theory the values should exactly match.
Instead of a test for equality sometimes expressions like abs(a - b) < 0.000001 are
used, ie, we take the absolute value of the difference and compare it with a tiny
epsilon. If you ever should use a test like that, think carefully about it --
sometimes it may be better to make an even more complicated test regarding not the
absolute, but the relative difference of the numbers.

For floats we have the operators [.term]#+#, [.term]#-#, [.term]#*# and [.term]#/#
for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. For powers with integral
exponents you can use the [.term]#^# operator, but you have to import it from the
math module. [.term]#x ^ 3# is the same as [.term]#x * x
* x#. The math module contains many more functions like [.term]#sin()# or
[.term]#cos()#, [.term]#sqrt()# and
[.term]#pow()#. [.term]#sqrt()# is short for square-root, [.term]#pow()# for power,
so [.term]#pow(x, y)# is x to the power of y, when both operands have type float.

The operators [.term]#+#, [.term]#-#, [.term]#*# and [.term]#/# can be used also when one operand is a
float variable and the other operand is an int literal. But when one operand is a float variable and the other
is an int variable, then a type conversion is necessary like in [.term]#float(myIntVal) * myFloatVal#.

As for integer variables Nim supports also the compatible types cfloat and cdouble which match
the C types float and double when the C backend is enabled.  For most C compilers C float matches
Nim's float32 and C double matches Nim's float64.

****
Some CPUs and C compilers support also other floating point types beside the common
float32 and float64 types. Intel x86 compatible CPUs generally support float80 math operations,
and the gcc C compiler may support float128. But these types are not yet supported
by the Nim compiler of A. Rumpf. 
****

=== Distinct types

Before we continue with subrange types we should introduce the distinct types.  In
the real world we have a lot of quantities for which the set of meaningful math
operations is restricted and which should not be mixed with quantities of other
types.  For example we may have the quantities time and distance measured in seconds
and meters and mapped to the float or int data type. While adding seconds and adding
meters is a valid operation, adding seconds to meters makes no sense and would be a
program bug if it should occur in the program code. But again dividing a distance by
a time period resulting in the average speed would be a valid operation. Nim provides
the distinct keyword which allows us to define new data types that are based on existing types, but
that are not compatible with them or with other distinct types. And the new defined distinct
types have no predefined operations, we have to define all desired operations our self.

[source, nim]
----
type
  Time = distinct float # in seconds
  Distance = distinct float # in meters
  
var t: time = 0.2 # not allowed
var t: Time = Time(0.2)
----
 
For distinct types we have to define all the allowed operations our self. We can
convert distinct types to the base types and then use operations of the base
type or we can borrow operations from the base type by use of the {.borrow.}
pragma. Using distinct types can be complicated when the new type should
support many operations, but it can make our code more save. For some
data type with a very limited set of operations distinct types can be
used easily. Distinct types are explained in detail in the Nim manual, we
may explain then in more detail in later sections. For now it is enough that
we know about their existence. 
 
=== Subrange types

Sometimes it makes sense to limit the range of numeric variables to only a sub-range.
For this Nim uses the [.key]#range# keyword with this notation: [.key]#range[LowVal .. HighVal]#.
Values of this type can never be smaller than LowVal or larger than HighVal.

[source, nim]
----
type
  Year = range[2020 .. 2023] # software update required at least for 2024!
  Month = range[1 .. 12]
  Day = range[1 .. 31]

var d: Day = 0 #Error: conversion from int literal(0) to Day is invalid
----

For the above example the base type of the defined ranges is int, so the ranges are
compatible with the predefined int type, we can assign values of int type to our
range types and vice versa. The size of the range types is the size of the int type.
If we try to assign to a range type a value that falls not into the allowed range
then we get a compile-time or run-time range error.  This can help us to prevent or
to discover errors in our programs. We can also declare subrange types with float
base types like [.term]#type Probability = range[0.0 .. 1.0]#.

Note that we can still mix different sub-range type:

[source, nim]
----
var d: Day = 13
var m: Month = 3
d = d + m
----

Such an operation is generally a bug, to prevent it we can put the distinct keyword
in from of our ranges. But then again we have to define the allowed operations our
self.

=== Enums

While enums in C are nothing more than integers with some special syntax for
creation, Nim's enums are more complex.

In Nim enums can be used whenever some form of symbols are needed like the colors
red, yellow and green of a traffic light or the directions north, south, east and
west for a map or a game.

Most of the time we declare an enum type and the corresponding values by simple
listing them like 

[source, nim]
----
type
  TrafficLight = enum
    red, yellow, green
----

We can use variables of type TrafficLight then like

[source, nim]
----
var tl: TrafficLight
tl = green
if tl == red:
  tl = ...
----

Enums support assignment, plain tests for (in)-equality and for smaller or greater.
Additional the functions succ() and pred() are defined for enums to get the successor
or predecessor of an enum, ord() or int() deliver the corresponding integer number
and the $ operator can be used to get the name of an enum. We can also iterate over
enums, so we can print all the colors of our  TrafficLight by

[source, nim]
----
for el in TrafficLight
  echo el.ord, ' ', $el
----

Ordinary enums start at 0 and uses continues numbers for the internal numeric value,
so that enums can be used as array indices.

[source, nim]
----
type
  A = array[TrafficLight, string]

var a: A
a[red] = "Rot"
echo a[red]
----

But we can also assign custom numbers like

[source, nim]
----
type
  TrafficLigth = enum
    red = -1, yello = 3, green = 8
----

We should avoid that, as these "enums with holes" generate some problems for the
compiler and may be later deprecated. For example array indexing or iterating is
obviously not possible for enums with holes.

It is also possible to set the string that the stringify operator $ returns, like in 

[source, nim]
----
type
  TrafficLigth = enum
    red = "Stop"
    yellow = (2, "Caution")
    green = ("Go")
----

Here the assigned numerical values should be 0, 2 and 3. Currently the enums values
must be specified in ascending order always.

When we have many enums in a program then name conflicts may occur, for example we
may have an additional enum type named BaseColor which also has red and green members.
For that case the {.pure.} pragma exists:

[source, nim]
----
type
  BaseColor {.pure.} = enum
    red, green, blue
----

With the pure pragma applied we can use the full qualified enum name when necessary,
like BaseColor.red. But we can still use unqualified names like blue when there is no
name conflict.

=== Boolean types

Boolean types are used to store the result of logic operations. The type is called
bool in Nim and can store only two values, false and true. Although we have only two
distinct states for a boolean variable and so one single bit would suffice to store a
bool, generally a whole byte (8 bits) is used for storing a boolean variable. Most
other programming languages including C do the same. The reason is that most CPU's
can not access single bits in the RAM -- the smallest entity that can be directly
accessed in RAM is a byte.  The default initial state of a boolean variable is false,
corresponding to a byte with all bits cleared. 

[source, nim]
----
var
  age = 17
  adult: bool = age > 17
  iLikeNim = true
  iLikeOtherLangaugeBetter = false.
----

In line three we assign to the variable adult the result of a logical comparison. The
next two lines assign the boolean constants [.term]#true# and [.term]#false# to the
variables, with their type [.term]#bool# inferred.

Variables of type [.term]#bool# support the operators [.term]#not#, [.term]#and#,
[.term]#or# and [.term]#xor#. Not inverts the logic value, [.term]#a and b# is only
true when both values are true, and false otherwise. And [.term]#a or b# is true when
at least one of the values is true, and only false when both values are false.
[.term]#xor# is not used that often.  It is called exclusive or, [.term]#a xor b# is
false when both values have the same logic state, that is when both are true, or both
are false. When the values are not the same, than the result of the xor operator is
true.

=== Characters

The data type for single characters is called char in Nim. A variable of type char has 8 bits
and can store single characters. Indeed it stores 8-bit integers which are mapped to
characters. The mapping is described by the ASCII table. For example the integer
value 65 in decimal is mapped to the character A. When we use single character literals,
then we have to enclose the letter in single quotes. As only 8 bits are used to store
characters, we only have 256 different values, including upper and lower case
letters, punctuation characters and some characters with a special meaning like a
newline character to move the cursor in the terminal to the next line, or a backspace
character to move the cursor one position backwards. Single characters are not used
that often since we generally group them in sequences called strings to build text.

The initial ASCII table contains only the characters with numbers 0 up to 127,
here is an overview generated with the small program listed in the appendix:

----
Visible ASCII Characters

      +0   +1   +2   +3   +4   +5   +6   +7   +8   +9  +10  +11  +12  +13  +14  +15  
  0                                                                                 
 16                                                                                 
 32        !    "    #    $    %    &    '    (    )    *    +    ,    -    .    /  
 48   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    :    ;    <    =    >    ?  
 64   @    A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H    I    J    K    L    M    N    O  
 80   P    Q    R    S    T    U    V    W    X    Y    Z    [    \    ]    ^    _  
 96   `    a    b    c    d    e    f    g    h    i    j    k    l    m    n    o  
112   p    q    r    s    t    u    v    w    x    y    z    {    |    }    ~      
----

The position in the table is the sum of the number on the left and the number
on the top, ie, character A has position 64+1=65, which is the value
the Nim standard function [.term]#ord('A')# or [.term]#int('A')# would return. The characters
with a decimal value less than 32 can not be printed and are called control
characters, like linefeed, carriage return, backspace, audible beep and such.
Character 127 is also not printable, and is called DEL. An important property of
this table is the fact that decimal digits and upper- and lower-case letters
form contiguous blocks. So to test for example if a characters is an uppercase
letter we can use this simple condition: [.term]#+c >= 'A' and c <= 'Z'+#.

Characters with ord() > 127 are so called umlauts, exotic characters of other
languages, and some special characters. But these characters may be different
on different computers, as the characters depend on the active code-page, which
maps position to actual character, and there are multiple code pages.
When we need more than the plain ASCII characters, then we use
strings in Nim, which display many more glyphs by using UTF-8 encoding.

The control characters with a decimal value less than 32 can not be typed
on the keyboard directly and for some characters with decimal value greater
than 126 it can be difficult to enter them on some keyboards. For these characters
as well as for all other characters escape sequences can be used. Escape sequences
start with the backslash character, and the following characters are interpreted in a special way:
The backslash can follow a numeric value in decimal or hexadecimal encoding, or a letter
which is interpreted in a special way. We mentioned already that the character 'A' is mapped
to the decimal value 65, which is its position in the ASCII table. So instead of 'A' we could use the
escape sequence '\65' for this character. Or, as decimal 65 is 41 in hexadecimal notation [.term]#(4 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0)# we
can use '\x41' where the x indicates that the following digits are hexadecimal. For common, often used
control characters it is not easy to remember their numeric value, so another notation with a
letter following the backslash can be used. For the important newline character we can use the
decimal numeric value '\10', the hexadecimal value '\xA' or the symbolic form '\n'. Here the letter n
stands for newline. The following table lists a few important control characters:

[cols=4*,options="header"]
[%autowidth]
|===
|Decimal
|Hexadecimal
|Symbolic
|Meaning

|10
|xA
|\n, \l
|newline or linefeed -- move cursor one position down

|12
|xC
|\f
|formfeed

|9
|x9
|\t
|tabulator

|11
|xB
|\v
|vertical tabulator

|92
|x5C
|\\
|backslash

|39
|x27
|\'
|single quote, apostrophe

|7
|x7
|\a
|alert, audible beep

|8
|x8
|\b
|backspace

|27
|x1B
|\e
|Escape, [ESC]

|13
|xD
|\r, \c
|return or carriage return -- move cursor at the beginning of the line

|===

The hexadecimal numbers after the [.term]#\x# character can by upper or lower case
and can have one or two hexadecimal digits.   For symbolic control characters
like '\a' for alert the upper case variant '\A' seems to be identical currently.
The single quote entered as ''' does give an error message, so you have to
escape it as '\''. Unfortunately by supporting this form of escaping it becomes
impossible to enter a backslash character directly, so we have to escape the
backslash character as '\\' to print a single backslash.

For Nim the most important control character is '\n' which is used to start the output
in a terminal window at the beginning of a new line. But '\n' is generally not used
as a single character but embedded in strings, that is sequences of characters. We
will learn more about strings soon. Note that the echo() function inserts a newline
character automatically after each printed line, but the write() function does not:

[source, nim]
----
echo 'N', 'i', 'm'
stdout.write  'N', 'i', 'm', '\n'
----

What may be a bit confusing is the fact that we use the backslash character as
escape symbol, and at the same time above table has an entry '\e' which is also
called [ESC]. These '\e' control character with decimal value 27 is fully unrelated
to the backslash character that we use to type in control characters. [ESC] is
a special character to start control sequences, it was used in the past to
send special commands to printers or modems, and can be used to
control font style or colors in terminal windows.

Nim's control characters should, with few exceptions, be identical with control characters
of the C language, so you may also consult C literature for more details.

=== Ordinal types

In Nim integers, enumerations, characters and the boolean types are ordinal types.
Ordinal types are countable and ordered, and for each of these types a lowest and
largest member exists. The integer ordinal types supports the inc() and dec()
operations to get the next larger or next smaller value, and the other ordinal types
use succ() and pred() for this operation. These operations can produce overflow or
underflow like errors if applied to largest or smallest value.  The function ord()
can be used on ordinal types to get the corresponding integer value.  Note that
unsigned integers are currently not called ordinal types in Nim, and that these
unsigned types wrap around instead of generation overflow and underflow errors.

=== Sets

From mathematics we know that sets are some form of unordered collection for which we
can test membership (x is included in mySet) and we can perform general set
operations like union of multiple sets.  In Nim we can have sets of all the ordinal
types.  All elements in a set must have the same base type.  A set can be empty, or
it can contain one or multiple elements.  For a specific element it can be contained
in a given set or it can be not contained, but it can be never contained multiple
times.  One very basic set operation is the test if an element is contained in a set
or is not contained in it.  Sets are unordered data types, that is sets containing
the same elements are always equal, it does not matter in which sequence we added the
elements.  Important set operations are building the union and building the
difference: The union of set a and set b is a set which contains all the elements
that are contained in set a or in set b (or in both).  The intersection of set a and
b is a set which contains only elements which are contained in set a and in set b.

The mathematical concept of sets maps well to words and bits of computers, as most
CPU's has instructions to set and clear single bits and to test if a bit is set or
unset. And CPU's can do [.op]#and#, [.op]#or# and [.op]#xor# operations which corresponds to the union and
intersection operation in mathematical set.

Nim supports sets with base type bool, enum, char, int8, uint8, int16 and uint16.
Note that we need a bit in the computer memory for each member of the base type. The
types char, int8 and uint8 are 8 bit types and can have 2^8 = 256 distinct values, so
we need 256 bits in the computer memory to represent such a set. That would be 8
bytes or four 64 bit words. To represent a set of the base type uint16 or int16 we
need already 2^16 bits, that is 2^13 bytes or 2^10 words on a 64 bit CPU. So it
becomes clear that supporting base types with more than 16 bit makes not much sense.

We will start our explanation with sets with character base type as these sets are
very easy to understand and at the same time very useful. Let us assume that we have
a variable of character type and we want to test if that variable is alphanumeric,
that is if it is a lower or upper case letter or a digit.  A traditional test would
be (x >= a and x <=z) or (x >= A and x <= Z) or (x >= 0 and x <= 9). Using Nim's set
notation we can write that in a simpler form:

[source, nim]
----
const
  AlphaNum: set[char] = {'a' .. 'z', 'A' .. 'Z', '0' .. '9'}
  
var x: char = 's'
echo x in AlphaNum
----

Here we defined a constant of set[char] types which contains lower and upper case
letters and the decimal digits. We used the range notation to save us a lot of typing
({'a', 'b', 'c', ...}).  It works in this case only, as we know that all the
lowercase letters, the upper case letters and the decimal digits built an
uninterrupted range in the ASCII table.

With that definition we can use a simple test with the [.key]#in# keyword. These test is
equivalent to the procedure call AlphaNum.contains(x). In compiled languages set
operations are generally very fast as they map well to CPU instructions.

Older languages like C have not a dedicated set data type, but as sets are so useful
and efficient, C emulates these operations by using logical [.op]#and# and [.op]#or# operations in
conjunction with bit shifts.

Two important operations for sets are building the union and the intersection:

[source, nim]
----
const
  AlphaNum: set[char] = {'a' .. 'z', 'A' .. 'Z', '0' .. '9'}
  MathOp = {'+', '-', '*', '/'} # set[char]

  ANMO = AlphaNum + MathOp # union
  Empty = AlphaNum * MathOp # intersection
----

The constant ANMO would now contain all the characters from  AlphaNum and from
MathOp, that is letters, digits and math operators. The constant Empty would get all
the characters that are at the same time contained in set AlphaNum and in set MathOp.
As there is not a single common characters, the set Empty is indeed empty.
Remembering the two operators [.op]#+# and [.op]#\*# for union and intersection is not easy. For the
intersection operator [.op]#*# it may help when we imagine the set members as bits, and we
assume that we multiply the bits of both operands bitwise, that is we multiply the
set or uset bits at corresponding position each. The resulting bit pattern would get
set bits only for positions where both arguments have set bits.

We can use the functions incl() and excl() to add or remove single set members:

[source, nim]
----
var s: set[char]
s = {} # empty set
s = {'a' .. 'd', '_'}
s.excl('d')
s.incl('?')
----
 
The result is a set with letters a, b, c and the characters _ and ?.  Note that
calling incl() has no effect when the value is already included in the set, and
calling excl() has no effect when the value is not contained in the set at all.

Another operation is the difference of two sets -- [.code]#a - b# is a set which contains only
the elements of a which are not contained in b.  In Nim there is currently no
operator for the complement or the symmetric difference of sets available. We can
produce a set complement by using a fully filled set and then removing the
elements of which we want the complement.  For a character set that would look like
{'\0'..'\255'} - s, where s is the set to complement. And the symmetric difference of set a and set b can be generated
by the operation [.code]#(a+b) - (a*b)# or by  [.code]#(a-b) + (b-a)#.

As the not operator binds more tightly than the in operator, we have to use
brackets for the inverted membership test like not(x in a) or we can use the [.op]#notin#
operator and write [.code]#x notin a#.  We can test for equality of sets a and b like a == b and for subset relation [.code]#a
< b# or [.code]#a <= b#. [.code]#a <= b# indicates that b contains at least all members of a, and [.code]#a < b#
that b contains all members of a and at least one more element.

Finally we can use the function card() to get the cardinality of a set variable, that
is the number of contained members.

We should also mention that we can have character sets which are restricted to a
range of characters:

[source, nim]
----
type
  CharRange = set['a' .. 'f'] 

# var y: CharRange = {'x'} #invalid 

var y: CharRange = {'b', 'd'}
echo 'c' in y
----

In the code above the compiler detects the assignment to variable y as invalid.

Set of numbers work in principle in the same way as sets of characters.  One problem
is that in Nim integer numbers are generally 4 or 8 bytes large, but sets can contain
only numbers with 1 or 2 byte size. So we have to specify the type of set members
explicitly:

[source, nim]
----
type
  ChessPos = set[0'i8 .. 63'i8]

var baseLine: ChessPos = {0.int8 .. 7.int8}
var p: int8
echo p in baseLine
----

In the code above we defined a set type which can contain int8 numbers in the range 0
to 63.

We can use also another notation for numeric sets when we define an explicit range
type like in

[source, nim]
----
type
  ChessSquare = range[0..63]
  ChessSquares = set[ChessSquare]

const baseLine = {0.ChessSquare .. 7.ChessSquare}
# or
const baseLineExplicit: ChessSquares = {0.ChessSquare .. 7.ChessSquare}
assert baseLine == baseLineExplicit
----

What may be a bit surprising is the fact that Nim's sets work also for negative
numbers:

[source, nim]
----
type
  XPos = set[-3'i8 .. +2'i8]

var xp: XPos = {-3.int8 .. 1.int8}
var pp: int8 = -1
----

Enum sets are also very useful and can be used to represent multiple boolean
properties in a single set variable instead of using multiple boolean variables for
this purpose:

[source, nim]
----
type
  CompLangFlags = enum
    compiled, interpreted, hasGC, isOpenSource, isSelfHosted
   CompLangProp = set[CompLangFlags]
  
const NimProp:  CompLangProp = {compiled, hasGC, isOpenSource, isSelfHosted}
----

Enum sets can be used to interact with functions of C libraries where for flag
variables often or'ed ints where used. For example for the gintro C bindings there is
this definition:

[source, nim]
----
type
  DialogFlag* {.size: sizeof(cint), pure.} = enum
    modal = 0
    destroyWithParent = 1
    useHeaderBar = 2

  DialogFlags* {.size: sizeof(cint).} = set[DialogFlag]
----

Here the {.size.} pragma is used to ensure that the byte size of that set type
matches the size of integers in C languages.

When we define set of enums in this way to generate bindings to C libraries, then we
have to ensure that the enum values start with zero, otherwise Nim's definition will
not match with  the C definition.  For example in the gdk.nim module we have

[source, nim]
----
type
  AxisFlag* {.size: sizeof(cint), pure.} = enum
    ignoreThisDummyValue = 0
    x = 1
    y = 2
    pressure = 3
    xtilt = 4
    ytilt = 5
    wheel = 6
    distance = 7
    rotation = 8
    slider = 9

  AxisFlags* {.size: sizeof(cint).} = set[AxisFlag]
----

The first enum with ordinal value zero was automatically added by the bindings
generator script to ensure type matching.  Nim devs sometimes recommend to use plain
(distinct) integer constants for C enums. That may be easier, but integer constants
provide no name spaces, so names may be aFlagWheel instead of AxisFlag.wheel or plain
wheel when there is no name conflict for pure enums. And with integer constants we
have to combine flags by or operation like (aFlagWheel or aFlagSlider) instead of
clean {AxisFlag.wheel, slider}.

Can we print sets easily? As sets are an unordered type, it is not fully trivial, but
we can iterate over the full base type and check if the element is contained in our
set like

[source, nim]
----
var s: set[char] = {'d' .. 'f', '!'}

for c in 0.char .. 255.char:
  if c in s:
    stdout.write(c, ' ')
echo ' '
----

----
! d e f
----

We will learn how the for loop work soon. Note that the sequence in which the
set members are printed is determined by our query loop, not by the set content
itself, as sets are unordered types.

=== Strings

The string data type is a sequence of characters. It is used whenever a textual input
or output operation is performed. Usually it is a sequence of ASCII-only characters,
but multiple characters in the string can be interpreted as so called utf-8
unicode characters, that allow displaying nearly unlimited symbols as long as all
the needed fonts are installed on your computer and you manage to enter them --
unicode characters may be not accessible by a simple keystroke. For now we will only use
ASCII characters, as they are simpler and work everywhere. String literals must be
enclosed in double quotes. Nim strings are similar to the Nim seq data types: both
are homogeneous variable-size containers. That means that a string or a seq expands automatically
when you append or insert characters or other strings. Don't confuse short strings with only one character
with single characters: A string is an non trivial entity with internal state like data buffer (the actual contained characters), length and storage capacity
why a character is nothing more than a single byte interpreted in a special way. So a string like
"x" is fully different from 'x'.

[source, nim]
----
var
  str: string = "Hello"
  name: string
echo "Please tell me your name"
name = readLine(stdin)
add(str, ' ')
echo str, name
----

In above example code we declare a variable called str and assign it the initial literal value
[.term]#"Hello"#. We use the [.term]#echo()# procedure to ask the user for his name, and use the [.term]#readLine()#
procedure to read the user input from the terminal. To show how we can add
characters to existing string variables we call the [.term]#add()# procedure
to append a space character to our str variable, and finally call the [.term]#echo()# procedure
to print the hello message and the name to the screen. Note that the [.term]#echo()# procedure
automatically terminates each output operation with a jump to the next line. If you
want an output operation without a newline, you can use the similar [.term]#write()#
procedure. But write() needs an additional first parameter, for which we use the
special variable [.term]#stdout# when we want to write to the terminal window.

So we could substitute the last two lines of the above code by

[source, nim]
----
write(stdout, str)
write(stdout, ' ')
echo name
----

The Nim standard library provides a lot of functions for creating and modifying strings, most of
these functions are collected in the system and in the strutils module. 
The most important procedures for strings are len() and high(). The len() procedure returns
the length of a string, that is the number of ASCII characters or bytes that the string currently contains.
The empty string "" has length zero. Note that the plain len() function returns the number of 
8-bit characters, not the number of unicode glyphs when the string should be interpreted as
unicode text. To determine the number of glyphs of unicode strings you should use some of the
unicode modules. The high() function is very similar to the len() function, it returns the index
of the last character in the string. For each string s high(s) == len(s) -1.
Remember that Nim supports method call syntax, so we can also write s.len instead len(s).
 
The most important
operators for strings are the subscript operator [.op]#[]# which allows access to individual characters
of strings, and the [.op]#slice# operator which allows access to sub-strings. The first character in a string
has always the index zero. For concatenation of string literals or string variables Nim uses the [.op]#&# operator. 

[source, nim]
----
var s = "We hate " & "Nim?"
s[3 .. 6] = "like"
s[s.high] = '!'
----

In the example above we define the string s by use of two literal strings to show the use of the concatenation operator.
In line two we use the slice operator to replace the substring "hate", that is the characters 3 up to 6,
with the string "like". In this case the replacement has exactly that many characters as the text to replace,
but that is not necessary: We can replace substrings with longer or shorter strings, which includes the
empty string "" to delete a text area.
In the last line of above example we use the subscript operator [.op]#[]# to replace the single character '?' at the
end of our string with an exclamation mark. For subscript and slice operators Nim supports also a special notation
which indicates indexing from the end of the string. Python and Ruby use negative integers for this purpose, while
Nim uses the [.op]#^# character. So [.code]#^1# is the last character, [.code]#^2# the one before the last. So we could have written
[.code]#s[^1] = '!'# for the last line of our code fragment above. The reason that Nim does not use negative integers for this purpose is that
Nim arrays don't have to start at index zero, but can start with an arbitrary index including negative indices, so
for negative indices it may be not always clear if a regular index or a position from the end of the string is desired.
The term [.code]#s[^x]# is equivalent to [.code]#s[s.len - x]#. We will learn some more details about the slice operator in a later section
when we have introduced arrays and sequences.

Another important operator for strings is the "toString" or stringify operator [.op]#$#.
It can be applied to nearly all data types and converts them to strings which can then be printed.
Some procedures like echo() apply this operator on its arguments automatically. When we define
our own data types then it can make some sense to define the  [.op]#$# for them, in case we
need a textual representation of our data -- maybe only for debugging purpose. Note that
applying the [.op]#$# operator on a string directly has no effect and is ignored, as the result would not change.

Strings can contain all characters of the char data type including the control characters. The most
important control character for strings is the newline character '\n' which is used at the end
or sometimes also in strings to start a new line. For strings Nim also supports the virtual character
"\p" to encode an OS dependent line break. When compiled for Windows, "\p" is automatically
converted to "\r\n", and to plain '\n' on Linux. Note that "\p" can be used in strings, but not as
single character, as it is two byte on Windows. "\p" is only needed to support very old Windows version or maybe other exotic
{os}, as modern Windows recognizes plain '\n' well.

As strings support utf-8 unicode, an escape sequence starting with "\u" is supported to insert unicode codepoints.
The "\u" follows exactly 4 hexadecimal digits or an arbitrary number of hex digits enclosed in curly braces {}.

As string literals are enclosed in quotation marks, it follows that strings can not directly contain this
character, we have to escape it as in [.term]#"\"Hello\", she said"#. 

Maybe we should mention that Nim strings use copy semantics for assignment. As we have not yet
introduced ref objects or pointers, copy semantics is what you should expect -- strings
behave just like all the other simple data types we used before like integer or float numbers or enums and characters:

[source, nim]
----
var
  s1: string
  s2: string
s1 = "Nim"
s2 = s1
s1.add(" is easy!")
echo s1 & "\n" & "s2"
---- 

The output is

----
Nim is easy!
Nim
----

The assignment [.term]#s2 = s1# creates a copy of s1, so the subsequent add() operation does
only modify s1 but not s2. Probably not surprising for you, but other programming languages
may behave differently, ie. the assignment may not copy the textual content but create only
a reference to the first string, so that modifying one of then also effect the other. We will learn more
about the concept of references when we introduce the object data type. 

==== Entering Unicode Characters

UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding. To cite the introducing section from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8:

****
UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064[nb 1] valid character code points in Unicode using one to four one-byte (8-bit) code units. Code points with lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using fewer bytes. It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII: the first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ASCII, so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well. Since ASCII bytes do not occur when encoding non-ASCII code points into UTF-8, UTF-8 is safe to use within most programming and document languages that interpret certain ASCII characters in a special way, such as "/" (slash) in filenames, "\" (backslash) in escape sequences, and "%" in printf.
****

In Nim we have four ways to enter unicode characters: As hexadecimal digits following the "\x", as unicode
codepoint following the "\u" or we can type the unicode sequence directly on our keyboard, as one single
keystroke when our keyboard layout supports that, or as a special OS dependent sequence of
keystrokes:

[source, nim]
----
echo "\xe2\x99\x9A \xe2\x99\x94"
echo "\u265A \u2654"
echo "\u{265A} \u{2654}" # {} is only necessary for more than 4 hex digits
echo "♚ ♔"
----  

The code above shows three was to print the symbol for a black and a white king of a chess game.
In the first line we typed the unicode sequence directly as hexadecimal digits, this method is
rarely used today. In the second line we used "\u" to enter the codepoint directly, we get the
code from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters. And finally we entered
the glyph directly in an editor. For some Linux editors like gedit we can hold down shift and
control key and then type u, release all keys and type the unicode digits like 265a and a space.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_input for details and other {os}.

==== The CString data type

In the C language strings are just pointers to sequences of characters of fixed length.footnote:[We
will explain later in this book what pointers are, so if you have no idea for what pointers are used
in computer programming, then just ignore it for now.] 
The end of such a C string is generally
marked with the character '\x0'. C functions like printf() needs this "\x0" characters to determine the
end of the C string. While Nim strings are entities that store its current size and other properties, and
can grow dynamically, the character sequence of Nim strings has also a hidden terminating '\0' character
at the end to make them compatible with C strings. Nim has also the data type cstring, called
"compatible string" in modern Nim, which matches
the strings in C language if we compile as usual with C backend. Cstrings are used in bindings definitions for C libraries, but as cstrings can not grow and
do support only few string operations, they are only used in rare cases in ordinary Nim source code. 
The Nim compiler passes automatically the zero terminated data buffer of Nim strings to C libraries whenever
we call a C library, so there is no expensive type conversion involved. But the other way is much more expensive: When
you have an existing cstring and need a Nim string with same content, then a simple conversion is not
possible as a Nim string is a different, more complex entity. So we have to create a Nim string and copy the
content, you can use the stringify operator [.op]#$# for this like in [.term]#myNimStr = $myCString#.
Generally string creation is an expensive operation compared to plain operations like adding two numbers,
so when performance matters one should try to avoid unnecessary string creation and also unnecessary
string operations. This is mostly important in loops, which are executed often. We will explain more about
the internal of strings and why string creation and dynamically allocating memory is expensive in later sections of the book.

****
When we access text ranges with the slice operator or single characters with the subscript operator
we should never access indices below the currently last index, which is the index mystr.high or ^1.
If we do that we get an exception, as that index would contain undefined data or would not exist at all.
We said earlier that Nim strings grow automatically if we insert or append data. But that does not mean
that we can use the subscript or slice operator to access characters after the current end of the string.
Such an operation would really make not much sense: Imagine we have a string var str = "Nim" and now
use the subscript operator and assign a character at position 10 with str[10] = '!'. What should become the content
of characters 4 .. 9? Well maybe spaces would make some sense, but in fact such an access after the currently
last valid character of the string is forbidden. You could do str.add("      !") for this purpose.   
****

==== Escape Sequences in Strings

We learned about control characters already in the section about characters, and earlier in this section
we mentioned that strings can also contain control characters. As the use of control characters may be
not really easy to understand, we will explain their use in  strings in some more detail and
give a concrete example.

The most important control characters for strings is the newline character, which moves the cursor in the terminal
window to the beginning of the next line. The [.term]#echo()# procedure prints that character
automatically after each output operation. Indeed it can be important to terminate
each output operation with that character, as the output can be buffered, and writing
just a string without a termination newline may not appear at once on the
screen, but can be delayed. That is bad when the user is asked something and should
respond, but the message is still buffered and not yet visible.

The problem with special characters like backspace or newline is that we can not enter
them directly with the keyboard.footnote:[Well we have a backspace key on our
keyboard, but generally it does not insert a backspace character but deletes the character
to the left of the cursor when we are editing text. And the return key, well,
it indeed inserts a newline character, but at the same time
in our editor the cursor moves to the next line. Most of the
time we desire a character that generates a newline when we run our program,
but not when we enter our source code.] To solve that problem, escape sequences
were introduced for most programming languages. An escape sequence is a special
sequence of characters, that the compiler can discover in strings and then replace
with a single special character. Whenever we want a newline in a string we
type it as [.term]#"\n"#, that is, the backslash character followed by an ordinary
letter n, n for newline. 

[source, nim]
----
echo "\n"
echo "Hello\nHello\nHello"
----

The first line prints two empty lines -- two because the [.term]#\n# generates a jump to next
line, and because [.term]#echo()# always adds one more jump to next line. The second line prints
three lines which each contains the word Hello, and the cursor is moved below the
last Hello, because [.term]#echo()# automatically adds one more newline character.

Older Windows versions used generally a sequence of two control characters to start a
new line, one '\r' (carriage-return) to move to the start of the line, and one '\l'
(linefeed) to move down. You may still find these two characters in old Windows text
files at the end of each line. Old printers used these combination too, so it was
possible to send that text files to old printers directly. Nim also has the special
escape sequence "\p" which is called platform dependent newline and maps to  "\c\l"
on Windows. That is when we compile our program on Windows, then the compiler
replaces "\p" in our strings with a carriage-return and a linefeed character, and
when we compile on Linux then the compiler replaces "\n" only with a newline
character.  But modern Windows supports '\n', so we generally can use that. 

==== Raw Strings and multi-line Strings

In rare situations you may want to print exactly what you have typed, so you do not
want the compiler to replaces a \n by a newline character. You can do that in two ways:
You can escape the escape character, that is you put in front of the backslash one
more backslash. When you print the string "\\n" you will get a backslash and the n
character in your terminal. Or you can use so called raw strings, that is you put the
character r immediately in front of your string like

[source, nim]
----
echo r"\n"
echo "\\n"
----

Multi-line strings are also raw strings, that is contained escape-sequences are not
interpreted by the compiler, and additional multi-line strings, as the name implies,
can extend over multiple lines of the source text. Multi-line texts starts and ends
with three quotes like in

[source, nim]
----
echo """this is
three lines
of text"""

echo "this is\nthree lines\nof text"
----

Both echo() commands above generates exactly the same machine code!

=== Comments

Comments are not really a data type, but they are also important. Ordinary comments
starts with the hashtag character # and extend to the end of the line. The #
character itself and all following characters up to the line end are ignored by the
compiler. You can also start the comment with ##, then it is a documentation
comment. It is also ignored by the compiler, but can be processed when you use later
tools to generate documentation for your code. Documentation comments
are only allowed at certain places, often they are inserted at the beginning
of a procedure body to explain its use.
There are also multi-line comments,
which starts with the two characters
+#[+ and ends with +]#+. These form of comment can extend over multiple lines
and can be nested, that is multi-line comments can contain plain or multi-line
comments. 

[source, nim]
----
# this is comment
## important note for documentation
#[ a longer
but useless comment
#]
----

Multi-line documentation comments also exists and can also be nested.

[source, nim]
----
proc even(i: int): bool =
  ##[ This procedure
  returns true if the integer argument is
  even and false otherwise.
  ]##
  return i mod 2 == 0
----

You can also use the +#[+ comment +]#+ notation to insert comments everywhere in the source code at places
where a whitspace character is allowed, but these form of in source comments is rarely used.

=== Other data types

There exists some more predefined types like the container types array and seq, which
can contain multiple objects of the same type, or the tuple type which can contain
different types. And we have sets, and enums and finally objects. Nim objects are
similar to C structs, they are not so verbose as Java classes. We will learn more
about all these types in later sections of the book.

== Nim Source Code

You have already seen a few examples of simple Nim source code. The code is
basically a plain text file consisting of ASCII characters, that is the ordinary
characters which you can type on your keyboard. Generally Nim source code can also
contain unicode utf-8 characters, so instead of using names consisting of ASCII characters
for your symbol names, you could just use single unicode characters or
sequences of unicode characters. But generally that makes not much sense, entering
unicode is not that easy with a keyboard, and it is displayed only correctly on the
screen or in the terminal when the editor or terminal supports unicode properly and
when all necessary fonts are installed. That may be the case for your local computer,
but what when someone other may edit your source code?

Nim does currently not allow to insert tabular characters (tabs) in your source code, so you
have to do the indentation of blocks by spaces only. Generally we use two spaces for
each indentation level. Other numbers work also but you should stick to a fixed
value. 

Names in Nim, as used for modules, variables, constants, procedures, user defined types and
other symbols may contain lower and upper case letters, digits, unicode characters and additional
underscores. But the names are not allowed to start with digits or to start or end with an underscore, and
one underscore may not follow directly after another underscore.

[source, nim]
----
var
  pos2: int # OK
  leftMargin: int # OK
  next_right_margin: int # OK
  _privat: int # illegal
  custom_: int # illegal
  strange__error: int # illegal
----

Generally we use camel case like leftMargin for variable names, not snake case like
left_margin.

Current Nim has the special property that names are case insensitive and that
underscores are simple ignored by the compiler. The only exception is the first
letter of a name, that letter is case sensitive. So the names leftMargin, leftmargin
and left_margin are identical for the compiler. But LeftMargin is different to all
the others, because it starts with a capital letter. This may sound a bit strange at
first, but works well in practice. One advantage is, that a library author may use
snake case in his library for names, but the users of the library can freely decide
if they prefer camelCase. But still you may think that all this generates confusion.
In practice it does not, it prevents confusion. Imagine a conventional programming
language, fully case sensitive and not ignoring underscores: In a larger program we
may then have names like nextIteration and next_Iteration or keymap and keyMap. What
when both names are visible in current scope, and we type the wrong one. The compiler
may not detect it when types match, but the program may do strange things. Nim would
not allow that similar looking names, as the compiler would regard them as identical
and would complain about a name redefinition.

You may ask why the first letter is case sensitive. That is to allow for user defined
types to use capital type names and then write something like [.term]#var window: Window#.
So we can declare a variable named window of a user defined data type named
Window. That is a common practice.

The case insensitivity and the ignoring of underscores may be not the greatest
invention of Nim, but it does not really hurt. The only exception is when we make
bindings to C libraries, where leading or trailing underscores are used, that can
make some renamings necessary.

The only minor disadvantage of Nim's fuzzy names is when you use tools like grep
or your editor search functionality: You could not be sure if a search for "KdTree"
would give you all results, you would have to try "Kd_Tree" or "KDTree" and maybe
some more variants too. For that task Nim provides a tool called nimgrep that
does a case- and style-insensitive search. And maybe your editor supports
that type of search also. You can also enforce a consistent naming scheme
when you call the compiler with the command line argument [.term]#--styleCheck:error#
or [.term]#--styleCheck:hint#.

****
Languages like C uses curly braces to mark blocks, while other languages like Pascal
uses begin/end keywords for this purpose. At the same time blocks are generally
indented by tabs or spaces to make it easier for the programmer to recognize
the extent of the block. This is some redundancy which is not always helpful --
block marks and indentation range can contradict each other and can generate
strange bugs. Like Python or Haskell Nim does not need additional block markers,
the indent level is enough to mark the block extend for the compiler and the
human programmer. This style looks clean and compact and was used in pseudo-code
of textbooks for decades already. Some people still argue that this style is
less "safe", as the behavior of the code depends on invisible white-space.
But this is a strange argumentation -- the white-space is always visible
due to the fact that there are visible characters on the right. Of course
changing the indention of the last line of a block would effect the 
behavior of the code. But that change is well visible. And program
code contains many locations where changing one character breaks it.
All numeric literals would suffer from adding a digit or deleting a digit.
Or the operators like ++ or += from C -- the code may compile well after deleting
the leading +, but it would be wrong. Computer programming is working carefully!
Indeed use of curly braces for blocks has some advantages, eg. many editors
can highlight such blocks well, editor may support jumping back and forth between the braces,
and for really large blocks it may be indeed simpler to discover the whole block range.
But practice has shown that marking blocks with indentation only works fine, most people
who have used it for some time just prefer it.

//For rare cases, like copy and past of long blocks,
//maybe from other peoples code, indentation may not work that well. But computer
//programming is different from writing a PhD thesis.  
****

== Control Structures

The most important control structures of Nim are the if statement for conditional
execution, the related case statement and the while loop for repetitions.

All these structures can be nested in arbitrary ways, so we can have in one if branch
other if conditions or while loops, and in while loops again other control structures
including other loops. 

=== If Statement and If Expression

The if statement with the optional elif and else parts evaluates
a sequence of conditions. As soon as one condition evaluates as true the
corresponding statement block is executed, and after that the program
execution continues after the whole if construct. That is at most one
branch is executed. If none of the conditions after the if or elif keywords
evaluates to true, then the else branch is executed if it exists. 

[source, nim]
----
if condition1:
  statement1a
  statement1b
  ...
elif condition2:
  statement2a
  statement2b
  ...
elif condition3:
  statement3a
  statement3b
  ...
elif ...:
  ...
else:
  statementa
  statementb
  ...
----

The most simple form of an if statement is

[source, nim]
----
if condition:
  statement
----

[source, nim]
----
if age > 17:
  echo "you may drink and smoke, but better avoid it!"
----

Note that the statements are indented by spaces, we use two spaces generally, but
other numbers work as well. And note that it is [.term]#elif#, not elsif like in Ruby, and
that there is a colon after the condition. Instead of a single statement we can use
multiple each, all on its own line and all indented in the same way.

****
No, the terminating colon is not really necessary for the compiler, the
compiler could determine the end of the condition without it, as the following
statement is indented. But it looks better with colon, the colon makes it for humans
easier to understand the structure of the whole if statement. So the compiler expects the
colons and complains otherwise currently.
****

We can also have if/else expressions which returns a value like in

[source, nim]
----
var speed: float = if time > 0: delta / time else: 0.0 # prevent div by zero error
----

In C for a similar construct the ternary ? operator is used.

In languages like C or Ruby the assignment operator = is an expression which returns
the value on the left, so we can write code like

[source, c]
----
while (char c = getChar()) { process(c)}
---- 

In Nim the assignment operator is not an expression with a result, but we can group
multiple statements in round brackets separated by semicolon, and when
the last statement in the bracket is an expression, than the whole bracket has
the same value. So we can use conditional terms like

[source, nim]
----
while (let c = getChar(); c):
  process(c)
----

If we declare a variable in this way using the var or let keyword then that variable
is only visible in the bracket expression itself and in the following indented block.

Note that if-expressions must always return a well defined value, so
they must contain an else. A plain if without else, or an if/elif without an
else does not work. And as Nim is a statically typed language and all
variables have a well defined type, the if-expression must return the same type for
all branches!

[source, nim]
----
var a: int
var b: bool
a = if b: 1 elif a > 0: 7 else: 0 # OK
a = if b: 1 elif a > 0: 7 # invalid
a = if b: 1 # invalid
a = if b: 1 else: 0.0 # invalid, different types!
----

=== The When Statement

The when condition is similar to the if statement, but while the if condition
is evaluated at program runtime, the when condition is already evaluated at
compile time. In ordinary program code the when condition is not used that often,
but it is very important and useful when we write bindings to C libraries and low
level code.  An important condition for the when statement is the isMainModule
condition and the test for defined symbols like defined(windows):

[source, nim]
----
when not defined(gcDestructors):
  echo "You may try to compile your code with option --gc:arc"
when isMainModule:
  doAllTheTests()
----

We will discuss the use of when statements, the isMainModule condition
and defined symbols in more detail later.

=== The Case Statement

The case statement is not used that often, but it can be useful when we have many
similar conditions:

[source, nim]
----
case inputChar
of 'x': deleteWord()
of 'v': pastWord()
of 'q', 'e': quitProgram()
else: echo "unknown keycode" 
----

To enable optimizations the case construct has some
restrictions compared to a more flexible if/elif statement:

The variable after the [.term]#case# keyword must have a so called ordinal type like
int, char or string, while float would not work. And the values
after each [.term]#of# keyword must be constant, that is a single constant value,
multiple constant values or a constant range like [.term]#'a' .. 'd'# for
the 4 first lower case letters. Of course these constants must have a type
compatible to the type of the variable after the case keyword. A case
statement must cover all possible cases, so most of the time an
else branch is necessary. 

Unless the similar switch statement in C the case statement needs
no break after each branch. If a condition after a [.term]#of# keyword is true, then 
the corresponding statement or statement sequence is executed, and after
that program execution continues after the whole case construct.

The case construct can also be used as an expression like in

[source, nim]
----
var j: int
var i: int =
  case j
    of 0 .. 3: 1
    of 4, 5: 2
    of 9: 7
    else: 0
----

Here an else is necessary to cover all cases. And as you see
we can also indent the block after the case keyword if we want.

=== The While Loop

The [.term]#while# loop is used when we want to do conditional repetitions, that is if we want to
check a condition and want to execute a block of statements only as long as the
condition is true. If the condition is false in advance or becomes false after some
repetitions then the program execution proceeds after the indented block.

A basic while loop has this shape:

----
while condition:
  statement1
  statementN
firstStatementAfterTheWhileLoop
----

[source, nim]
----
var repetitions = 3
while repetitions > 0:
  echo "Nim is easy!"
  repetitions = repetitions - 1
----

That loop would print the message three times. Like the condition in the if clause
the condition is terminated with a colon. Note that the condition must change during
execution of the loop, otherwise, when the condition is true for the first iteration,
it would remain true and the loop would never terminate. We decrease the loop
counter repetitions in the loop, so at some point the condition will become false and
the loop will terminate and program execution will continue with the first statement
after the loop body. Note how we decrement the loop counter: The right site of the
assignment operator is evaluated, after that is done, the new value is assigned to
the counter.

There exists two rarely used variants of a while loop: the loop body can contain a
[.term]#break# or a [.term]#continue# statement, which each consists only of this single keyword. A
break in the body stops execution of the loop immediately and continues execution
after the loop body. And a continue statement in the body skips the following
statements in the body and starts at the top again, the while condition is evaluated
again.

[source, nim]
----
var input = ""
while input != "quit":
  input = readLine(stdin)
  if input == "":
    continue
  if input == "exit":
    break
----

Above code used the [.term]#==# and the [.term]#!=# operator. The == operator does a test
for equality, and != test for inequality. Both operator work for
most data types like integer, floats, characters and strings. The
literal value of an empty string is written "". In line 2 we test
if the variable named input has not the value "quit", and in
line 4 we test of that variable is empty, that it contains no text
at all. 

Using of break and continue destroys the expected flow in
loops, it can make understanding loops harder. So we generally avoid their use, but
sometimes break or continue are really helpful. For example when an unexpected error
occurs, maybe by invalid user input.

There in no repeat loop as in Pascal in Nim, which does the first check at the end of
the loop when it was executed already for the first time. Repeat loops are not used
that much in Pascal, and they are some sort of dangerous, because they check the
condition after the first execution of the body, so maybe the body is executed with
invalid data for the first iteration. Later we will see how we can use Nim macros to
extend Nim by a repeat loop that can be used as it would be part of Nim core
functionality.

=== For Loops and Iterators

These are very useful and important in Nim and other languages. For loops are most
often used to iterate over containers or collections. We have not discussed the
important array and seq containers yet, but we know already the string container.

A string contains characters, the characters are numbered starting with 0, and we can
access single characters of a string with the subscript operator [.term]#[]# which gets the
position of the desired character as argument. So we could print the single
characters of a string, in this way:

[source, nim]
----
var
  s = "Nim is not always that easy?"
pos = 0
while s[pos] != '?':
  echo "-->", s[pos]
  inc(pos)
----

It is obvious that the pos variable is some sort of annoying here -- we want to
process all the characters in the string in sequence, so why would we have to use a position
variable to do that. And this way is susceptible to errors, maybe we forget
increasing the pos variable in the loop body. So most modern languages provide us
with iterators for this purpose:

[source, nim]
----
var
  s = "Nim is not always that easy?"
for ch in items(s):
  echo "-->", ch
----

That is obvious shorter. The for construct may appear a bit strange, and it is
indeed, but it is a common way to write iterators, it is used in Python too. Ruby
uses something like s.each{|ch| ...} instead.

For loops in Nim iterates over containers or collections, and pics each element in
sequence in this process. The variable after the for keyword is used to access or
to reference the single elements. That variable has automatically the right type,
which is the type of the elements in the container, and get in each iteration the
value of the next element in the container, starting by the first element in the
container and stopping when there is no element left. [.term]#Items()# is here the actual
iterator, which allows us to access the individual characters in sequence. It exists
the convention in Nim that an [.term]#items()# iterator is automatically called in a for
construct when no iterator name is explicitly given, so we could also write shorter
[.term]#for ch in s:# in this use case.

You may recognize that the output of the above for loop is not identical to the
output of the previous while loop. The while loops stops when the last character, that is
'?', is reached, while the for loop processes this last character still. That is
intended for the for loop, its general purpose is to process all the elements in
containers or collections.

The above for loop does a read access to the string, that is we get basically a copy
of each character, and we can not modify the actual string in this way. When we want
to modify the string, there is a variant available.

[source, nim]
----
var
  s = "Nim is not always that easy?"
for ch in mitems(s):
  if ch == '?':
    ch = '!'
----

Here we use mitems() instead of the plain items(), the leading m stands for mutable.
In the loop body we can assign different values to the actual content.

== Objects

We have worked with basic data types like numbers, characters and strings already.
Often it makes sense to join some variables of these basic data types to more complex
entities. Assume you want to build an online store to sell computers, and you want to
built a database for them. The database should contain the most important data of
each device type, like type of CPU, RAM and SSD size, power consumption,
manufacturer, quantity available, and actual selling price.

We can create a custom object data type with fields containing the desired data for
this purpose:

[source, nim]
----
type
  Computer = object
    manufacturer: string
    cpu: string
    powerConsumption: float
    ram: int # GB
    ssd: int # GB
    quantity: int
    price: float
----

We have to use the [.term]#type# keyword to tell the compiler that we want to define a new
custom type.
Writing the type keyword on its own line begins a type section where we can
declare one or more custom data types. All type declarations in a type
section must be indented.
In the next line we write our type name, an equal sign and the keyword
[.term]#object#. That indicates that we want to declare a new object type named Computer.
Here Computer is a type name, in Nim we use the convention that user defined type names start with
a capital letter. In the following indented block we specify the desired fields,
each line contains the name of a field, and a colon followed by the needed data type.
That is similar like a plain variable declaration.

Objects in Nim are similar to structs in C. Unlike classes in Java Nim objects
contain only the fields, sometimes also called member variables, but no procedures,
functions or methods, and no initializers or destructors as in {cpp}. In Nim we keep
the data objects, and the procedures, functions, methods and also optional
initializers and destructors that work with that data objects separated.

Now that we have defined our own new object type, we can declare variables of that
type and store content in its fields.

[source, nim]
----
var
  computer: Computer

computer.manufacturer = "bananas"
computer.cpu = "x7"
computer.powerConsumption = 17
computer.ram = 32
computer.ssd = 1024
computer.quantity = 3
computer.price = 499.99
----

Of course in real applications we would fill the fields not in this way, but we would
maybe read the data from a file, from terminal or maybe from a graphical user
interface.

It may look a bit ugly that we have to write [.term]#computer.# before each field when we
access the fields. Indeed in recent Nim versions that is not necessary, you may use
the [.term]#with# construct now instead.

[source, nim]
----
import std/with
var
  computer: Computer
with computer:
	manufacturer = "bananas"
	cpu = "x7"
	powerConsumption = 17
	ram = 32
	ssd = 1024
	quantity = 3
	price = 499.99
----

We can use the fields like ordinary variables:

[source, nim]
----
computer.quantity = computer.quantity - 1 # we sold one piece
echo computer.quantity
----

As you already know, the right side of the assignment operator is evaluated first,
then the result is stored in the variable on the left side. But we can also just write
[.term]#computer.quantity -= 1# or [.term]#dec(computer.quantity)#.

Generally a computer store would offer many different types of computers, so it would
make sense to store all the different devices in a container like a sequence, called
short seq in Nim.

== Arrays and Sequences

Sequences and arrays are homogeneous containers, they can contain multiple other
elements of the same data type, while a plain variable like a float or an int only contains a single value.
In some way we could regard objects also as containers, because objects contain multiple fields.
The same holds for tuples -- tuples are a very simple, restricted form
of objects and also contain fields. But more typical container data types are the
built in arrays and sequences, or for example hash tables which are provided by the
Nim standard library. Arrays, sequences and hash tables can contain multiple
elements, but all elements must have the same data type, which we call the base type.footnote:[The base types can be
sum types, we will discuss them later.] 
The data type of the base type is not restricted, it can be even again array or sequence types, so we can built
multidimensional matrices in this way.
Arrays have a fixed, predefined
size, they can not grow or shrink during runtime of our program. Sequences and hash
tables can grow and shrink.

Arrays and sequences appear very similar, a sequence appears even more powerful
because it can change its size, that is the number of elements that it contains, at
runtime, while an array has a fixed size. So why do we have arrays at all? The reason
is mostly efficiency and performance. An array is a plain block of memory in the RAM
of the computer, which can be accessed very fast and needs not much care by the
runtime system. Sequences take much more effort, especially when we add elements and
the sequence has to grow. When we create sequences, we can specify how many elements
should fit in it at least and the runtime system reserves a block of RAM of the
appropriate size. But when our estimation was too small, and we want to append or
insert even more elements, then the runtime system may have to allocate a larger
block of memory first, copy the already existing elements at the new location, and
then release the old, now unnecessary memory block. And this is an relative slow
operation. The reason why this process can be necessary is, that the initially
allocated memory block may not increase in size because the neighborhood in the RAM
is already occupied by other data. Now let us see what we can do with arrays and
sequences:

[source, nim]
----
var
  a: array[8, int]
  v = 1
for el in mitems(a):
  el = v
  inc(v)
for el in mitems(a)
  el = el * el
for square in a:
  echo square
----

In the second line of the code above we declare a variable named a of array type -- we want to use an
array with exactly 8 elements, and each element should have the data type int.
To declare a variable of array data type we use the array keyword followed
in square brackets by the number of the elements, and separated by a comma, the
data type of the elements. We can also specify the range of the
indices explicitly by specifying a range like array[0 .. 7, int] or array[-4 .. 3, int].
The first specification is identical to the one in above example program, and
the second one would allow us to access array elements with index positions
from -4 up to 3.footnote:[It can be difficult to remember if we have to write [8, int] or
[int, 8]. It may help to remember that for plain variables the data type comes last also like in var i: int.]

The
first for loop of above program fills our array -- that is for each of the 8 storage places in the array
we fill in some well defined data. We use the [.term]#mitems()# iterator here, because we want
to modify the content of our array -- we fill in numbers 1 .. 8. In the next for loop
we square each storage location, and finally we print the content. In the last for
loop we do not modify the content, so a plain items() instead of mitems() would work,
but we already learned that we have not to write the plain items at all in this case.

Sequences work very similar like arrays, but they can grow:

[source, nim]
----
var
  s: seq[int]
  v = 0
while v < 8:
  inc(v)
  add(s, v)
for el in mitems(s)
  el = el * el
for square in s:
  echo square
----

We start with an empty seq here, and use the [.term]#add()# procedure to append elements.
After that we can iterate over the seq as we did for the array.

In the same way as we accessed single characters of a string with the subscript
operator, we can use that operator to access single elements like in a[myPos].
The slice operator is available for arrays and sequences too and can be used
to extract sub-ranges or to replace multiple elements. As arrays have a fixed length,
the slice operator can only replace elements in arrays, but not remove or insert
ranges. 
The
first element position is generally 0 for arrays and sequences. Arrays can even be
defined in a way that the index position starts with an arbitrary value, but that is
not used that often. Whenever you use the subscript or slice operator you have to ensure that
you access only valid positions, that is positions that really exists. a[8] or s[8]
would be invalid in our above example -- the array has only places numbered 0 .. 7,
and for the seq we have added 8 values which now occupy positions 0 .. 7 also,
position 8 in the seq is still undefined. We would get a runtime error if we would
try to access position 8, as well when we would try to access negative positions.
You might think that an assignment for a seq like s[s.length] = 9 is the same
as s.add(9), but only the add() operation works in this case.

Note that in some languages like Julia arrays start at position 1. Nim array can
have an arbitrary integral start position, including negative start positions, but start
position as well as highest subscript position are determined in the program source
code and can not change at runtime. We say that arrays have fixed compile-time
bounds. Seqs start always at position 0, we can specify an initial size, and we can
always add more elements at runtime.

Arrays and sequences allow fast access to its elements: All the elements are stored
in a continues memory block in RAM, and the start location of that memory block is
well known. As all the elements have the same byte size, it is an easy operation to
find the memory location of each element. The compiler uses the start location of the
array or seq, and add the product of subscript index and element byte size. The
result is the memory location of the desired element, which was selected by the index
used in the subscript operator. When the array should not start at position 0, then
the compiler would have to adjust the index, by subtraction of the well known start
index. This operation takes not much time, but still arrays starting at position 0
are a bit faster. We said that the compiler has to do a multiplication of index and
element size -- that is an integer multiplication, which is very fast. When the
element size is a power of two, then the compiler can even optimize the
multiplication by using simple shift operation, which may be even faster, depending
on your CPU.

It should be not surprising that the internal structure of seqs are a bit more
involved than arrays. Arrays are indeed nothing more than a block of memory,
generally allocated on the stack for local data or allocated in the BSS segment for
global data. Don't worry when you have not yet an idea what the stack, the heap and a
BSS segment is, we will learn that soon. The Nim seq data type has a variable size,
so it is clear that it needs not only a storage location for its elements, but also a
counter to store how many elements it currently contains, and another counter how
many it could contain at most. The element counter must be updated when we add or
delete elements, and when the counters tells that there is currently no more space
available for more elements, then a new block of memory must be allocated, and the
existing elements must be copied from the old location into the newly allocated
memory region, before the old memory region can be released.footnote:[Well with some
luck the RAM area after the currently used memory block is still unused. For this case
the OS may offer functions like realloc() to just increase our memory block size, so we can avoid
the copying of the contained data.]
Due to this additional
effort appending elements to a seq by using the add() procedure is not extremely
fast. You may wonder why we have not to save a size information for arrays. Well
arrays have fixed size, so it is obvious that we never have to adjust something like
a size counter, simple why it would never change. But would we have to save the
desired initial size of the array? Well, in some way yes. But it is a constant value.
During the compile process the compiler can catch some errors already for us -- when
we have an array as above with size 8, then the compiler would be able already at
compile time to recognize some invalid access to array elements -- a[9] would be a
compile time error for sure. But at runtime, when we execute our program, access to
not existing index position may occur, for example by constructs like var i = 9; a[i]
= 1 when the array is declared as var a: array[8, int]. For catching that type of
error the compiler has to store the fixed array size somewhere and to check against
that value when an array access by using the subscript operator with a non constant
argument occurs, as the a[i] above. One related remark: Accessing array elements is
as fast as ordinary variable access when we use a constant value as index, that is a
constant literal or a named constant. The reason for this is, that when the index is a
constant, then the compiler just knows the exact position of that array element in
memory, just as it knows the address of plain variables, so there is no need for
address calculations at runtime.

We said that appending elements to seqs is not extremely fast -- indeed it is a few
times slower than access to an array element by its index using the subscript operator. So when we know that our
seq will have to contain at least an initial amount of elements, then it can be useful
for maximum performance, that we allocate the seq from the beginning for this size
and than fill in the content by use of the subscript operator instead that we append
all the elements one by one. Here is one example:

[source, nim]
----
var s: seq[int] = newSeq[int](8)
var i: int
while i < 8:
  s[i] = i * i
  inc(i)
----

We use the newSeq() procedure to initialize the seq for us, the content of the
square brackets tells the newSeq() procedure that we want a sequence with base type int, and the number 8
as argument tells it that the newly created seq should have 8 elements with default value (0).
This
procedure is a so called generic procedure, it needs additional information, which is
the data type that the elements
should have. Don't confuse the square bracket in the newSeq[int]() call with the
subscript operator a[i] which we have used for array access, both are completely
unrelated.
Note that the initialization of the seq above does not restrict its use in any
way, we can still use it like an uninitialized seq, that is we can use the add()
operator to add more elements, we can insert or delete elements and all that.

****
In the section about strings we said that strings have value semantic, that is that
an assignment like str1 = str2 creates a copy of str2 and that after that assignment
str1 and str2 are fully independent entities -- modifying one does not change
the content of the other one. Array and sequences behave in the same way, both
have value semantic too. Indeed arrays are true value types in Nim, as they live
on the stack in the same way as plain variables like integers, floats or characters.
Sequences  have a dynamic data buffer which is allocated on the heap, so
it would be possible that an assignment like seq1 = seq2 would not copy
the data buffer but reuse the old one. In that case both sequences would be
not independent, seq2 would be an alias for seq1. This is called reference semantic, some languages like Ruby
behave in this way. But in Nim arrays, strings and sequences have value semantic,
an assignment creates an independent copy. We will learn more details about
reference semantic and the use of the stack or heap to store data soon when
we discuss references to objects.
****
 
== Slices

Nim slices are objects of type Slice that contain a lower bound [.ndef]#a# and an upper bound [.ndef]#b#.
Slice objects are used by functions of the standard library or by user defined functions
to access sub-ranges of strings, arrays and sequences. Applied on these container data types slices
look syntactically like sub-ranges:

[source, nim]
----
var
  m = "Nim programming is difficult."
m[19 .. 28] = "not easy."
echo m
echo "Indeed " & m[0 .. 18] & "is much fun!"
----

In line three we use the slice to replace the sub-string "is difficult."
which starts at position 19 with another string. Note that the replacement
can be a longer or a shorter string, that is the slice supports not only overwriting characters, but also
inserting or deleting operations. In the last line we use the slice
to access a sub-string and create a new string with it. As we learned earlier
in the strings section already, we can use the [.op]#^# operator to access elements
counted from the end of the container, so we could have written line three
also as  [.code]#m[19 .. ^1] = "not easy."#.

Slices can be used in a similar way for arrays, strings and sequences. But we have to remember that
slices are only objects with a lower and an upper bound, so there must be always a
{proc} that accepts the container and the slice as arguments to do the real work.

When we care for utmost performance, then we have to be a bit carefully with slices, as
slices can generate copies. Consider this example:

[source, nim]
----
type
  O = object
    i: int

proc main =
  var
    s = newSeq[O](1000000)
  for i in 0 .. (1000000 - 1):
    s[i] = O(i: i)
  
  var sum = 0
  for x in s[1 .. ^1]:
    sum += x.i
----

Here we use the slice operator to exclude the first element
from our summing operation. Unfortunately in current {curnim}
use of the slice operation in this way creates a copy of our sequence,
which increases the run-time and memory consumption. We may try to use the new toOpenArray() expression and try a construct like

[source, nim]
----
  for x in items(s.toOpenArray(1, s.high)):
----

but that does currently not compile.

One option is currently that we create a custom iterator like

[source, nim]
----
iterator span*[T](a: openArray[T]; j, k: Natural): T {.inline.} =
  assert k < a.len
  var i: int = j
  while i <= k:
    yield a[i]
    inc(i)
----

and use

[source, nim]
----
for x in s.span(1, s.high):
----

Or we may do the summing in a {proc} and pass that proc
an openArray created with toOpenArray() like

[source, nim]
----
proc sum(x: openArray[O]): int =
  for el in x:
    inc(result, el.i)
----

[source, nim]
----
echo sum(s.toOpenArray(1, s.high))
----

But this is work in progress, so the situation may improve, see

+ https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/4823

+ https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/4582#28715

== Value Objects and References

We have already used different types of variables -- integers, floats, or the custom
Computer object, and some more. We said that variables are named memory regions,
where the content of our variables is stored. We call this type of variables also
value objects.

Value objects always implies copies when we do an assignment

[source, nim]
----
var i, j: int
i = 7
j = i
i = 3
echo i, j
----

Here we have 3 assignments, first we assign the integer literal 7 to variable i, then
we assign the content of variable i to variable j, and finally we overwrite the old
content of variable i with the new literal value 3. The output of the echo statement
should be 3 and 7, because in line 3 we copy the content of variable i, which is
currently the value 7, into variable j. The new assignment in line 4 in no way
touched the content of variable j.

Maybe that is not too surprising, but when we would have references instead of plain
variables, then the situation would be different, as we will see soon.

Whenever possible we should use this simple form of variables, as they are fast and
easy to use.

But there exist situations where we need some sort of indirection, and then
references and pointers come into play. For example when the data entities depend in
some form on each other, the elements may build linked lists, threes or other
structures. The entities may have some neighborhood relation, also called some one to
many relation.

Indeed value objects and references occur in real life also:

Imagine you have baked a cake for your family, and you know that your friendly
neighbor loves cakes too. As you have still a lot of all necessary ingredients and
because the oven is still hot, you make one more identical cake to give it later to
your neighbor. We can think of the cake as a value type, and your second cake can be
considered as a copy. When you give the copy to your neighbor, then you have still
your own, and when you or the neighbor eats the cake, then the other one still
exist.

Now imagine that you know a good car repair shop. You can give the telephone number
or location of that car repair shop to your neighbor, so he can use that shop too. So
you gave him a reference to the shop, but you gave him not a copy. You can also
give some of your other friends each a reference to that shop, which is nearly no
effort for you. While backing a cake for all of them would be some effort.

You can regard names of persons as some sort of reference too. Imagine you have a
list with the names of all the people you intend to invite to your birthday party,
and another list with names of people who owe you money. Some names may be on both
list, this is it refers to the same person.

In computers the dynamic storage, called RAM, consists of consecutive, numbered
storage locations, called words. Each individual word has its address, which is a
number generally starting at zero and extending to a value which is defined by the
amount of memory available in your computer. These addresses can be used to access
the storage locations, that is to store a value at that address, or to read the
content again. Reading generally does not modify the content, you can read it many
times and will always get the same value. When your write another value to that
storage location, then reads will give you that new value.

Basically for all the data that you use in your program you need in some form its
address in the RAM, without the address you can not access it. But what is with all
the plain, value object variables we have used before, we have never used addresses?
That is true -- we used only names to access our variables, and the compiler mapped
our chosen name to the actual address of the variables in memory whenever we accessed
the variable. For most simple cases this is the best way to access variables. Now let us
assume we have such value object type of variable declared in our program, can we
access it without using its name? When we have declared it, it should reside
somewhere in the RAM when the program is executed. Well, when we do really not want
to access it by variable name, then there is still one chance: We can search in the
whole RAM for the desired content. In practice we would never do that, as it is
stupid and would take very long, but we could do. But how can we detect our
variable? How can we be sure that it is indeed ours? Generally we can not. Even when
we are sure that the variable must reside somewhere in the RAM, generally the
variable is marked in no way of course. Even when we would know the value which is
stored in that variable, we would only know what bit pattern it should have, so for
most words of the RAM with a different bit pattern we could say for sure that it can
not be our variable, but whenever we find the expected bit pattern than it can be
just a coincidence, there can be many more words in RAM with that content. In some
way it is as you would search a person and you know that that person lives in a long
road with numbered houses. If you only know that the person wears brown shoes but you
know not the number of the house nor the name of the person and no other unique
property of that person, then you have not much luck.

== References and Pointers

=== Introduction to Pointers

In Nim references are some form of smart or managed pointers, we will learn more about
references later. The plain pointer data type is nothing more than a memory address,
it is similar to a (unsigned) integer number. We say that a pointer points
to an entity when the pointer contains the memory address of that entity.

Beside the pointer data type, which is only some RAM address, we have also the ptr
entity. Ptr is not a datatype for its own, it is always used in conjunction with
another data type:

[source, nim]
----
var
 p: pointer 
 ip: ptr int
----

Here the variable p is of type pointer, we could use it to point to some arbitrary
memory address. The variable ip is of type [.term]#ptr int#, which indicates that it should
only point to memory addresses where a variable with data type int resides. So a ptr
is a pointer that is bound to a specific data type. Generally we speak only about
pointers, if we are referring to an untyped pointer or a typed ptr is generally clear
from the context.

When we only declare pointers but do not assign a value then the pointers have the
value [.term]#nil#, what indicates that they are regarded to point to nothing. Exactly
speaking a pointer can never point to nothing in the same way as an integer variable
can not contain no number. As an integer variable always contains a bit pattern, a
pointer also always contains a bit pattern. But we are free to define a special
pattern as nil, and whenever a pointer has this special value, then we know that it
does not really point to something useful. In C instead of nil NULL was chosen for
the same purpose. In practice nil and NULL are generally mapped to 0, that is a word
with all bits cleared. But that is more or less an arbitrary decision.

So how can we give our pointers above a useful value?

One possibility would be to use Nim's addr() function, which gives us the memory
address of each ordinary variable.

[source, nim]
----
var
 number: int = 7
 p: pointer 
 ip: ptr int
echo cast[int](p)
echo cast[int](ip)
p = addr(number)
ip = addr(number)
echo cast[int](p)
echo cast[int](ip)
----

First we declare an ordinary integer variable called number which will reside
somewhere in memory when we execute the program, and then we use the addr() function
to assign the address of that variable to p and ip. The addr() function is a low level
function provided by the compiler, it can be used to determine the memory address of
variables and some other entities known to the compiler.footnote:[Sometimes the compiler
may refuse to accept the addr() function, for example for variables defined with the let keyword.
For that case we may have to use the function unsafeAddr().] 
We used the echo() procedure to
show us the numeric decimal value of the addresses in the terminal. As it generally
makes not too much sense to print addresses, echo() would refuse to print it, so we
have used the construct cast[int](someValue) to tell that echo() should regard our
pointers as plain integer and print it. That operation is called casting, we
generally should avoid it, as it destroys type safety, but for learning purposes it
is OK to use it. We will learn more about casts and related type conversion later.

The first two echo statements should print the decimal value 0, as the pointers have
the initial default value nil.

The echos in the last two lines should print a value different from 0, as we have
assigned the valid address of an ordinary variable that resides somewhere in the RAM
when the program is executed. Both outputs should be identical, as we have assigned
for both pointers addr(number) each.

Maybe a funny fact is, that when you run the program multiple times the output of the
last two echo() statements print different values. But that is not really surprising
-- whenever you launch the program, then for our variable number a storage location
in RAM is reserved. And that location can differ for each new program execution. For your
next holiday in the same hotel, you may get a different room also.

So when we have the pointer ip pointing to a valid address, can we recover the
content of that memory region?
Sure, we use the de-reference operator [] for that purpose. Whenever we
have a typed pointer x we can use x[] to get the content of the memory location where
the pointer is pointing to. Note that the operator [] is not really related to the
subscript operator [pos] which we used earlier for array, seq and string access. Nim
uses ASCII characters for its operators, and that set is not very large. And maybe
it would even be confusing when we would have a different symbol for each operator.
We can consider [] as some form of content access operator -- mystring[pos] gives us
the character at that position, and ip[] gives us the content of the memory location
where ip points to.

[source, nim]
----
var
 number: int = 7
 ip: ptr int
echo cast[int](ip)
ip = addr(number)
echo cast[int](ip)
echo ip[]
----

What do you expect as output for the last echo statement? Note that for the last
echo statement we do not need a cast, as ip[] has a well defined type: ip has type
ptr int, so ip[] is of well defined type int and echo() can print the content.

Now let us investigate how we can use pointers to modify the content of variables:

[source, nim]
----
var
 number: int = 7
 ip: ptr int
ip = addr(number)
echo ip[]
ip[] = 3
echo ip[]
echo number
----

What do you expect for the output of the last echo() statement? Well remember, ip
points to the location where variable number is stored in RAM. So echo ip[] gave us
the content of number. Now ip[] = 3 is an assignment, the right site of the
assignment operator is the literal number 3, which is a value type. Earlier we said
that for value types an assignment is a copy operation, the right site of the
assignment operator is copied into the variable on the left site. Now ip[] stands
exactly for the same content as the name number, and so assigning to ip[] is the same
as assigning to number.

=== Pointer Arithmetic

In low level programming languages pointer arithmetic can be useful.
For example old C code often iterates with pointer arithmetic
over arrays by use of constructs like [.term]#sum += *(myIntPtr{pp})#. This was done
to maximize performance. Modern C compiler generally understands
statements like [.term]#sum += el[i]; i{pp}# well and generates very good assembly instructions
for it. So pointer arithmetic is not necessary in C that often today.

Nim does not provide math operations for pointers directly, but we can
always cast pointers to integers and do arbitrary math. And of course
we could define our own operators for that purpose, but generally
we should avoid that, as it is dangerous, error prone and generally not
necessary. As an example let us sum up some array elements:

[source, nim]
----
proc main =
  var
    a: array[8, int] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    sum = 0
  var p: ptr int = addr(a[0])
  for i in a.low .. a.high:
    echo p[]
    sum += p[]
    echo cast[int](p)
    var h = cast[int](p); h +=  sizeof(a[0]); p = cast[ptr int](h)
    #cast[var int](p) += sizeof(a[0]) # this compiles but does not work currently

  echo sum
  echo typeof(sizeof(a[0]))

main()
----

When we do pointer arithmetic or similar math to calculate the
address of variables in the computer memory, then memory addresses
are used like integer numbers, and so it makes same sense that Nim's
integers have the same byte size as pointers. 

=== Allocating Objects

In the previous section we learned the basics about pointers. We used the
addr() operator to initialize the pointer by assigning the address of an already existing
object. This is in practice not that often done, and it can be a bit dangerous, as
it is not always guaranteed that the variable on which we applied addr() will
exist as long as our pointer exist. So the pointer may point later to a memory location
that is already freed or used by a totally different object already. So the use
of addr() is more reserved for advanced programmers who know well what they do, and 
most of the time addr() is not necessary at all or is only necessary for really
low level code, maybe when interfacing with external libraries written in C.
Instead of using addr() to assigning to pointers a valid address, often procedures
like alloc() or create() are used to reserve a block of memory:

[source, nim]
----
var ip: ptr int
ip = create(int)
ip[] = 13
echo ip[] * 3
var ip2: ptr int
ip2 = ip
echo ip2[] * 3
dealloc(ip)
----

Here the procedure create() is used to reserve a block of memory, the int parameter
ensures that the block has the size of an integer value. After ip has a valid value,
we can store a value in that memory location and read it again. Note that multiple pointers
can point to the same memory location: We declared one more int ptr called ip2. But for
that pointer we do not allocate a new block, but we assign the old block that we
allocated for ip to ip2. Now both pointers points to the same object, the int value 13.
We may call ip2 an alias, as it is a different way to access the same object.

When we use alloc() or create() to allocate memory blocks, then we have
to deallocate them when we need them not any more. Otherwise that memory
blocks couldn't be reused. If we would continuously allocate memory blocks  and never
deallocate, that is free them, then at some point in time all memory would be
occupied -- not only for our own program, but for all programs running
currently on the same computer. We had to terminate our program -- when
a program is terminated then all resources get freed automatically by the OS.

The use of procedure pairs like alloc() and dealloc() is common practice in low level
programming languages like C, but it is inconvenient and dangerous: We can
forget to call dealloc() and waste resources, or we may even deallocate
memory blocks but still use it by our pointers. The later would at some point
of time crash our program, as we would use memory blocks which are already
released and may be used for other variables -- from our own program
or from other programs. Note that in the source code above there is only one
single dealloc() call. The reason for that is, that we only allocated
one single memory block in  one single create call, ip2 is only one more 
pointer that points to that block. If we would have used an addition
dealloc(ip2) call, then that would be a so called double free error.

As you see, using pointers is inconvenient and dangerous. But still
there are situations where plain value type variables do not suffice.
The solution of many higher level programming languages to this problem
is a Garbage-Collector (GC). The GC does the dangerous and inconvenient
task of deallocating unused memory blocks for us automatically.

To distinct the GC managed "pointers" cleanly from the manually
managed ones, we call them in Nim [.term]#references#, in some
other languages they are called traced pointers. References
are always typed like ptr, there is no equivalent to
the untyped pointer type for references.

For References we have still to do the allocation our self, then we
can use the references, and when we are not using them any more, then
the GC frees the corresponding memory block. A typical scenario is
that we use references in a procedure or in an otherwise
limited block of code: We declare the reference in that code block,
allocated and use it, and when the code block is left the GC frees
the allocated memory for us. You may think that the fact that we still have to
allocate the memory for our references our self is still a problem,
as we may forget that step. Well it is not that dangerous, when we forget
the allocation step, we would use a reference with value nil, which would immediate
result in a runtime error. So we would see the problem immediately. Other
pointer errors, like missing de-allocation or use after free are not that obvious
and more dangerous.

With references we can rewrite our previous example code in this way:

[source, nim]
----
var ip: ref int
new(ip)
ip[] = 13
echo ip[] * 3
var ip2: ref int
ip2 = ip
echo ip2[] * 3
----

We have replaced ptr by ref, and instead of alloc() or create()
we are using the new() proc which gets the uninitialized ref
as a parameter and allocates a managed memory block for it,
that is after the new() call ip has a well defines value referring to a
managed memory block that can store an integer value.
Again, we can use one more ref and assign that ref the value
of the other, so now both references the same memory block.
The advantage here is that we don't have to care about freeing
that block, the GC will do that when appropriate.

To verify that in the example code above both references really
reference the same object in memory, we could add two more lines
of code:

[source, nim]
----
ip2[] = 7
echo ip[]
echo ip2[]
----

Here we are using the reference ip2 to assign to
the memory block the literal value 7. After that assignment
both echo statements would display that new content.

Using references and pointers to store basic data types
like integers is not done that often, in most cases 
we work with larger objects, and we create some relations
between the objects. We will try that in the next section.

=== References to Objects

You should still wonder for what references are really useful --
they seem to be only a more complicated version of plain
value type variables.

Now let us assume we want to create a list of things or persons,
maybe a list of our previously used Computer data type, or
maybe a list of persons we will invite to our next party.
We will create the party list for now, as the Computer
data type we used before has already many fields, and 
filling all the fields would be some effort, so let us use
a new Friend data type which should store only the friends
name for the beginning -- we may add more fields later
when necessary. So we may have

[source, nim]
----
type
  Friend = object
    name: string
----

With that declaration we could declare a few friends variables
like

[source, nim]
----
  var harry, clint, eastwood: Friend
----

But that is not what we want, we would need a list
with all of our friends that we would like to invite
to our party, we would want to add friends to the list, and
maybe we would want to delete friends also. You may think we
could use Nim's sequence data type for that, and you are right.
But let us assume we could not use that predefined Nim data
type for some reason. Then we could create a list of linked
references to Person.

[source, nim]
----
type
  Friend = ref object
    name: string
    next: Friend
----

Now our Friend data type is a reference to an object,
and the object itself has an additional next field
which is again of type friend.

That is some sort of recursion. If that should appear as too
strange, then imagine you have some numbered paper cards, each with two
fields: One field name, one field next: In the name field you can
fill in a name of a friend, in the next field you fill
in the number of the next card. The last card in the chain
gets no entry in the next field.

Now we create a small Nim program which reads in names of our
friends from the terminal, creates a list of all friends, and
finally prints the list.

[source, nim]
----
type
  Friend = ref object
    name: string
    next: Friend

var
  f: Friend
  n: string

while true:
  write(stdin, "Name of friend: ")
  n = readline(stdin)
  if n == "" or n == "quit":
    break
  var nxt: Friend
  new(nxt)
  nxt.name = n
  nxt.next = f
  f = nxt

while f != nil:
  echo f.name
  f = f.next
----

This example code seems to be not that easy. But it is not really difficult, and
when you have understood it, you can call yourself a Nim programmer already.
Maybe you should think about the code above for a few minutes before reading the
explanations below.

First let us summarize what our program should do: It should read in some
names of our friends which we would like to invite to our next party.
Of course when entering the names, we would need a way to tell
that we are done. In  our program we can do that in two ways, we
can enter an empty name by just pressing the return key, or we
can enter the text "quit" to stop the loop. Unfortunately that means
that we can never invite a friend with that name to our parties.
When we have terminated the input loop, then the next loop
prints all the entries to the terminal.

Let us start with the type and variable declarations:
We use a user defined type named Friend which is a reference
to an object, that object type has a field name of type string,
and a field next which is again a reference to the same data type.

We are using two variables, on called n of type string to read
in a name or the quit command from terminal, and a variable called f
of type Friend. The variable f seems to match only to one single
friend, but as the type of f has a next field it can be a whole list
of friends, with f being the start or head of that list.

In the code above we are using a special while loop -- special
because the construct [.term]#while true:# and because the loop contains
a break statement. Earlier we said that we should avoid the
break statement in loops, because it interrupts the control flow and
can make it more difficult to understand and proof the flow.
But in this case that form makes some sense: For the first loop
we have to first read in a name from terminal and then we can decide
what to do, so we can not really evaluate a condition after
the while statement at the top. So we use the simple constant condition true,
which would never terminate the loop. We need a break inside the loop body to
terminate the loop.

//The second loop is also some sort of special -- we stop when
//the next field of our object variable is nil. But we can have the special
//case that we habe a list with only one freind, so next is nil for the
//first entry in the list, but still we had to pront the name of that
//single entry. Our form of the output loop covers this case well. We could
//rewrite boths loops without using a braek, but that would require some addidional code.

Let us investigate the second loop first as it is really easy:
In the while condition we check if current value of f is nil, that
is if there are no more entries in our list. For that
case we terminate the loop, as we are done. If f has not the
value nil, than f points to a valid content, that is there
is at least a valid name, which we access by the field access
operator and print it with echo f.name. Note that in Nim the
field access operator . works in the same way for value objects types as
well as for ref objects types. For ref objects types we could also write
f[].name instead of plain f.name, that is we first apply [] to
f to get the content, and then use . to access the name field.
In some other languages like C we would have to use
a special operator -> to access fields of pointer or reference types.

The most interesting statement in the output loop is f = f.next.
We assign the content of f.next to f and proceed with that new
content. The content could be a valid reference to one more friend object,
or it could be nil, indicating that our loop should terminate.

The input loop is also not that complicated: First we ask the user
to enter a name. We use write(stdin) for this, as echo()
always generates a newline, but we want to read in the name on the same line.
If the name is empty or has the special value "quit" then we terminate the input
loop. In the loop we are using a temporary variable nxt of type Friend, we
allocate a memory block for it with new(). Then we assign the read in name n to
the name field. The last two statements of the loop body are a bit demanding:
First we assign to nxt.next the value of f. Now nxt is basically the start of our list,
and it next field refers to the first element of the current list. Fine, but we said that
the nxt variable is only a temporary variable, we do not intent to use it longer as necessary.
But currently nxt is so useful, it is the head of our list. On the other hand, the former
list start f is now useless, current f is identical with nxt.next. So the trick is, we just
assign to f the value of nxt. Now f is the complete list, and we do not need nxt any more.
nxt can be used in the next loop iteration again, but we have to allocate a new memory 
block for the nxt reference, as the previous memory block is still in use, it contains the 
name which we just entered and also a reference to the next object in the list.

Note that we add the new elements at the top of the list in this way. We have done it that way
because it is very easy in this way. For adding at the end of the list, we would have to
use one more reference variable which allows us always access to the current end of the list, or
we would have to travel the list from head to tail whenever we would like to
add elements at the tail.

For one more exercise let us consider deleting entries in our list. Basically
that operation is very easy, we would just skip one entry. Lets adds this code to the
program above:

[source, nim]
----
while f != nil:
  write(stdin, "Name to delete: ")
  n = readline(stdin)
  if n == "" or n == "quit":
    break
  if f.name == n:
    f = f.next
  else:
    while f.next != nil:
      if f.next.name == n:
        f.next = f.next.next
        break
      f = f.next
----

Here we are using again an outer while loop to read in the names
which we want to delete. That loop uses the condition while f != nil:
because when the list is empty we should stop of course.

In the loop body we have an if statement, and
in the else branch of the if statement we have one more loop.
The reason why we need the if statement is, that the case that our
name to delete is the first in the list is some sort of special. Let us
//list contains only a single entry is some sort of special. Let us
investigate the inner loop first. That loop assumes that 
there are at least 2 elements in the list, f and f.next.
We compare the name of the next entry with n. If they match then we would have to
skip the next entry. We can do that by the statement  f.next = f.next.next. That is
we replace the reference from the current element f to the next list entry, that is 
f.next, by the next entry of the next element, which is (n.next).next. We do not have
to write the parenthesis. The n.next.next entry can be nil, in that case it is the end
of the list. If we found a matching name then we terminate the inner loop 
with a break statement, and we are done. Otherwise we assign to f the value of f.next and continue the loop
execution. Now to the special case that the name to delete is the first in the list.
//our initial list contains only a single entry.
//For that case the initial
//test of our inner loop  while f.next != nil: would be false, we would do nothing.
//If this case we have to set f to the next element in the list
We need the first if branch for that -- if already the first element matches
the name to delete than we just skip the first element by setting the head of the list to
the next entry, which may or may not be nil.

This is one way to solve the task, for operations on lists there exist in most
cases various solutions, some optimized to easy or short code, some for performance.
You may copy the code segment above to the end of the former code, and maybe 
add one more copy of our printing loop at the end again. Then you should have a program
that reads in a list, prints the contents, then ask for names to delete, and finally
prints the resulting list. Maybe you can improve the code, or maybe you can detect
special corner cases where it may fail. What is for example when some of your
friends have the same name? May the program fail in that case? Or you may 
add more fields to your Friend data type. Maybe a textual field with
content male or female, and you can report the ratio of male to female.
And maybe remove males from the list when we have more males then females?

For references to objects the assignment operator [.op]#=# copies the references, but not
the object. In the same way the operator [.op]#==# for equality test compares the references, but
not the content of the objects to which the references point. If you want to compare
the content of the objects, you can apply the dereference operator [.op]#[]# on both references:

[source, nim]
----
type
  RO = ref object
    i: int

var
  ro1 = RO(i: 1)
  ro2 = RO(i: 1)
  ro3 = ro1

echo ro1 == ro2 # false
echo ro1[] == ro2[] # true
echo ro1 == ro3 # true

== Procedures and Functions

=== Introduction

Procedures and functions, called proc and func in Nim, are
the most common way to structure larger programs in smaller parts
with a dedicated task. The terms procedure and function where
used in Pascal and the other languages of Wirth already, while
C uses the term function only, and Fortran generally uses the 
term subroutine instead. And Python and Ruby finally are using
the really strange names def and fun for it.

We call or invoke a proc by just writing its name followed
by a parameter list enclosed in parenthesis. The
parameter list can be empty. When we call a proc, then
the program execution continues with that procedure, 
and when the execution of the procedure terminates, then the
next statement after that proc call is executed. Sometimes
we say that we jump into a procedure and jump back when that
procedure terminates.

In Nim functions are a special form of procedures that return
a result and do not modify the current state of the program.
Modifying a global variable or an output operation would be
examples for modifying the state. We have already used some
predefined procedures like echo() for output operations, add() for
appending single characters to strings, and readLine() for
reading in textual user input. And we talked
about math functions like sin(), cos(), pow() -- these
are functions as they accept one or two arguments and return a result
but do not change a state -- calling them again with the same
arguments would always give the same result. ReadLine()
is only a proc, not a function, as the result may be different
for each call, and as we pass a file variable as argument, which
may change its state for each call, maybe because the file end is reached.
A function is only a special subtype of a procedure, the
func keyword indicates to the reader of the code and to the compiler
some special properties, that is that a result is returned
and that global state is not changed. Whenever the func keyword
is used a proc would do as well, and in this text we generally
speak about procedures, even when a function would do.

Let us start with a very simple function called sqr() for square.

[source, nim]
----
func sqr(i: int): int =
  i * i
----

A procedure declaration consists of the keyword proc, a user
selected name, a optional parameter list enclosed in
parenthesis  and an optional colon followed by a data type.

Note that this is only a declaration so far -- the
compiler could recognize the construct, its parameters
and its result type. Sometimes we call this construct
a procedure-header.

Generally we do not only declare a function, but we
define it, that is we add a equal sign to the
procedure header and add an indented procedure body
that contains the code that is performed for each
invocation.

Pure proc declarations can be necessary in rare situations, maybe
when two procedures call each other. In this case the procedure
defined first would call the other procedure, which is not
already defined, so the compiler may complain about a unknown
procedure. We could solve that problem by first declaring the second
procedure, so that the compiler would know about it existence.
We would then define that second procedure later, that is
closer to the end of the program file.

The sqr() proc above accepts an integer argument and
returns its square of same data type. We would
call that proc like

[source, nim]
----
var j: int
j = 7
echo sqr(j)
----

Earlier in this book we said that the compiler processes
our source code from top to bottom, and that the final
program is executed from top to bottom too. The first
statement is indeed true, for that reason it can be 
necessary to declare a function at the top, and define
it below, as we can not call a proc before it is declared or defined.

For the program execution  we have to know that
procs are only executed when we call them. That is, when 
we write a proc at the top of our source code, then that
proc is processed by the compiler, but it is not executed
during program runtime before we call it.

****
The procedure body builds a new scope. We can declare entities
like variables, constants, types or other {profus} in that scope.
These entities are only visible in the procedure body but
not outside of the proc. Will will learn more about scopes
and visibility soon.
****

==== Procedure Parameters of Var Type

Our sqr() function above accepts only one parameter and
that
parameter is a value type, which indicates that we can not
modify it in the procedure body. That fact is useful to
know for the caller of a proc, as one can be sure that 
the passed parameter is not modified and is available
unchanged after the proc call. But of course there
are situations where we may want that a passed parameter  
is modified. Let us assume we want to "frame" a passed
string, for example we want to pass in the string "Hello"
and want to change it to "* Hello *". Further let 
us assume that we may sometimes want to use other
characters instead of the asterisk, maybe a + sign.

[source, nim]
----
proc frame(s: var string; c: char = '*') =
  var cs = newString(2)
  cs[0] = c
  cs[1] = ' '
  insert(s, cs)
  add(s, ' ')
  add(s, c)

# we can call that proc like
var message = "Hello World"
frame(message)
echo message
----

The frame proc above accepts two parameters and returns no
result. The first parameter has the type string, it
is not a value parameter but a var parameter, which
is indicated by the var keyword between the colon and the
type of the parameter. Note that we use here again the keyword var
that we used earlier to declare variables. The main  reason that we
use again the same keyword is that we do not want to use a new one --
var proc parameters are different from var declarations.
Var parameters can be modified in the
procedure body, and that modification is visible after the proc call.footnote:[We
learned already about pointers, and passing var parameters
to {profus} is closely related to pointers: The compiler passes indeed the address
of the var parameter. But we have not to care about these details.]
The second proc parameter is a plain value type, it is a character
which has the default value '*'. Default values are useful for
parameters that have in most cases the same value, but can be
different sometimes. The advantage is, that when calling that proc
we can just leave that parameter out. For default values we have to
be a bit careful, only value parameter can have default values, and
when we call a proc with many parameters with default values it
may be not always clear which parameter we pass and for which parameter we want a default value.

To generate the frame around the passed in string we have to insert two characters
at the front of the string, and to append two characters. Inserting in strings
is not a very cheap operation, as it involves moving all following characters.
So we try not to insert two single characters, but we first create
a short string consisting of the passed c character and a whitespace character, and
then insert that two character string at the front of the passed string.
We use the standard procedure newString() with parameter 2 to create a new
string of length 2 with undefined content, and then fill in the content
by using the subscript operator. We could have used the add()
proc to add that two characters to an empty string, but that is a bit
slower. Then we use the standard procedure insert() to insert our two
character string at the front of our passed string. Finally we
add a whitespace and the c character to the passed string.
The passed string is now modified, it is 4 characters longer. That
modification is noticeable for the caller of that proc, that
is echo() will print the modified version.

When we call a proc or function with multiple arguments, then we have
to pass the arguments in the same order as they are specified
in the proc declaration.

Our frame() proc above modifies the passed string. We could have
instead decided that the proc should not modify the string, but should
return a new string consisting of the frame and the passed string in the center.
Generally when creating procs we have to decide what is more useful -- modifying a 
passed value or returning a modified copy. And sometimes we have to
regard efficiency too. Returning newly created large data types
like strings may be expensive. A string is not a trivial structure, as 
it contains the dynamic buffer for the string content, which has to
be allocated. On the other hand, for the passed var string we inserted
characters, which involves moving characters and is also not 
a really cheap operation, and maybe when we insert a lot, the
string buffer must be even enlarged, which is again expensive.
So for this use case it is not really clear what approach is better -- 
we used the var parameter mainly to introduce var parameters.
OK, let us investigate how a function that returns a modified
string may look:

[source, nim]
----
func framed(s: string; c: char = '*'): string =
  var res = newStringOfCap(s.len + 4)
  add(res, c)
  add(res, ' ')
  add(res, s)
  add(res, ' ')
  add(res, c)
  return res

# we can call that proc like
echo framed("Hello World")
echo framed("Hello World", '#')
----

Above code is one possible solution. We can use the keyword func instead of proc
here as we only return a result but modify no states. We pass
the initial string and the character for the frame both as plain value parameters
and return a newly created framed string. In the function body we start with an
optimized version of the procedure newString() from the system module,
called newStringOfCap(). Like newString() that procedure creates an empty
string variable, but it ensures that the data buffer of the new string has exactly the
specified size. That is an optimization, which makes sense in our use case, as we
know that our newly created string will have 4 characters more than the passed
string. So we can avoid that the result string has to be enlarged while we add
characters or the initial string, and we ensure at the same time that no space is wasted --
the data buffer size of the new string will be a perfect fit for the desired result.
The rest of the function body is not really interesting, we just add() what is needed
and return the result. Well, earlier we said that add() is not extremely fast. So when you
have to frame millions of strings each day you may consider avoiding add(), and
you know already enough about Nim to do it. Just try it. You may start with an
string of right size containing undefined content created by  newString(s.len + 4)
and then you may copy in the required data in a loop chararcter for character.
Or you may use the slice operator to insert the passed string into the new string.

  res[^2] = ' '

The situation that we may need a procedure that works on a var parameter in one case and
returns a modified copy in another case is not that rare. So for example Nim's standard library
contains a procedure called sort() which can sort container data types in place, and a procedure
called sorted() which returns a sorted copy. This code duplication is not really that nice. Of course sorted()
is the more universal solution, as we can always replace sort(data) with data = sorted(data).
But the later creates a temporary copy, which may not be optimal for performance.
Since Nim version 1.2 a dup() macro is available from sugar module which creates
copies of variables and then applies one or multiple in place procs on the copy.
So the procs sorted() or our proc framed() would be unnecessary. We can use dup()
as in this example:

[source, nim]
----
from sugar import dup

proc frame(s: var string; c: char = '*') =
  var cs = newString(2)
  cs[0] = c
  cs[1] = ' '
  insert(s, cs)
  add(s, ' ')
  add(s, c)

echo "Hello World".dup(frame)
echo "Hello World".dup(frame, frame)
echo "Hello World".dup(frame('#'))
----

Note that we apply frame() two times in the line before the last one -- in the same
way we could apply a sequence of different procs. The result of above program is

----
* Hello World *
* * Hello World * *
# Hello World #
----

The execution of a procedure terminates when the
last statement of the procedure body has been processed.
We can also terminate a procedure earlier when we
specify a [.term]#return# statement somewhere.

Functions and procedures which return a result
can also terminate with the last expression of
the procedure body, or earlier with a return expression
like [.term]#return i * i#. Functions and procedures with a result
declare automatically a result variable for us, which we may
use or just ignore. So for our previous sqr() function we have
various ways to write it:

[source, nim]
----
func sqr1(i: int): int =
  i * i

func sqr2(i: int): int =
  result = i * i

func sqr3(i: int): int =
  return i * i
----

For short and simple procedures
the first form is often used. For longer procedures
where the result is constructed in multiple
steps, like some string operations, using the
result variable makes sense. And finally, when
there exist multiple points where we may jump back
using return statements may make sense. One use
case is an early error check, maybe we want to
return -1 as some form of error indication when 
we write a procedure that should calculate the
square root of an integer value. (Well in Nim we have 
other and sometimes better ways to catch errors, we
will learn about that later.)

Generally we should avoid writing something like

[source, nim]
----
func sqr(i: int): int =
  result = i
  i * i
----

as it may be unclear in this case if the expression i * i is returned or
the result variable with value i. For {curnim} we will get
a warning or an error message in such a case.

Note that we used the proc names sqr1, sqr2 and sqr3 above.
Using the same name with the same argument types multiple
times would result in a redefinition error, as the
compiler could not know what proc body should be executed
when that proc name is called.

But Nim supports so called proc overloading, that is
we can use the same name when the parameter list is different,
as the compiler can select from the parameters in the proc call
which proc has to be called:

[source, nim]
----
func sqr(i: real): real =
  i * i
----

We have only changed the parameter and result data type.
Now there is no conflict with the proc with same name which
we defined for integers. Note that Nim use only
the parameter list for overload resolution, but not the
result type of a proc or function. The reason for that
is that Nim supports type inference, and that would not work
when we would have two procs with same name each accepting an int parameter 
but one returning an int and one returning a float number.

Nim does also support named arguments in proc calls, that is we could invoke
the proc above with sqr(i = 2.0). Named arguments
can be useful when procs or functions have many arguments,
maybe some with default values, and we do not remember
the order of parameters or when we want to specify only a few.

==== Objects and Ref Objects as Procedure Parameters

In the previous section we learned that we have to pass var parameters
when the procedure should be able to mutate the variable permanently.
This is also valid when the parameters are objects. When a
procedure should modify fields of an object parameter, then we have to
pass that object as a var parameter. In the following example proc t1
gives a compiler error because that procedure tries to modify a field of
an object while the object instance is not passed as a var parameter.
If we remove proc t1 then we can compile and run the example:

[source, nim]
----
type O = object
  i: int

proc t1(o: O) =
  o.i = 7 # Error: 'o.i' cannot be assigned to

proc t2(o: var O) =
  o.i = 13

proc main =
  var x = O(i: 3)
  echo x.repr
  t2(x)
  echo x.repr

main()
----

The output is:

----
[i = 3]
[i = 13]
----

Proc t2 gets a var parameter and can modify fields of the passed object.
Here we used the expression echo x.repr to print the whole object.
Strings and sequences are value objects in Nim, so you have to
pass them as var parameters when you want to change their length
or when you want to modify elements. This code would give you compile
errors, unless you add the var keyword to make the proc parameters mutable:

[source, nim]
----
proc t1(s: string) =
  s.setLen(7)
  s[0] = 'x'

proc t2(s: seq[int]) =
  s.setLen(7)
  s[0] = 13
----

This was not really surprising. But what when we use a reference to
an object and pass that to procedures as value and as var parameter?
In the code below proc t1 gets a variable of type ref object and
the procedure can modify fields of the passed instance. That can be
indeed surprising. In this case passing the ref object without use of the
var keyword means only that we can not mutate the ref value itself in
the procedure, but we are allowed to modify the fields of the object.
For proc t2 we pass a var parameter. As always we can modify a var 
parameter in the procedure, so we can assign it a newly created instance.

[source, nim]
----
type O = ref object
  i: int

proc t1(o: O) =
  o.i = 7

proc t2(o: var O) =
  o = O(i : 11)

proc main =
  var x = O(i : 3)
  echo x.repr
  t1(x)
  echo x.repr
  t2(x)
  echo x.repr

main()
----

When we compile and run above code we get:

----
ref 0x7f054a904050 --> [i = 3]

ref 0x7f054a904050 --> [i = 7]

ref 0x7f054a904070 --> [i = 11]
----

For a ref object the repr function gives us
the address of the object instance in memory and the
contents of its fields. The first two echo statements
shows the same address, indicating that proc t1 has
modified only a field of our instance, the instance 
itself (its address in memory) was not changed.
But proc t2 has created a new instance and assigned that value
to the variable x in the main procedure. We notice this as
the address of variable x has changed. The old instance variable
with address 0x7f054a904050 is now unused and will be
freed by the Nim memory management.

=== Special Argument Types: OpenArray and Varargs

The openArray and varargs data types can be used only in 
parameter lists.
OpenArray is a type which allows to pass arrays and sequences
to the procedure or function. Allowing that makes
sense as arrays as well as seqs store their content
in a block of memory, which can be processed uniformly.
Although arrays generally do not have to start with index
number 0, when passed as openArray the first element
is mapped to index 0, and the index of the last element is
available by using the high() function on the passed array
parameter. Whenever we write a procedure that accepts an array
or a sequence, we should consider using the openArray parameter type
to allow passing in both data types. Strings can be passed also
to procs accepting openArrays with char base type. Note that a
proc with openArray parameter type can not change the length of a passed seq,
as for the openArray parameter type sequences are handled like arrays.
So in the code below proc t1 generates a compiler error while
t2 compiles and works fine.

[source, nim]
----
proc t1(x: var openarray[int]) =
  x.setLen(7)

proc t2(x: var seq[int]) =
  x.setLen(7)
----

The varargs parameter type is similar to the openArray type, but
it additional allows passing an arbitrary number of single arguments.
The compiler automatically collects the single arguments into an array for us,
so in the proc body we can use it like an array, ie. iterating over it.

[source, nim]
----
proc print(s: varargs[string]) =
  for el in s:
    stdout.write(el)
    stdout.write(", ")
  stdout.write('\n')

print("Hello", "World") # compiler builds the array for us
print(["Hello", "World"]) # we generate the array our self
----

There exists a variant of the varargs argument type that
performs a type conversion automatically by applying a
proc on all arguments. For example varargs[string, `$`]
would apply the stringify operation on the passed arguments
automatically. That is what echo does.

Varargs arguments may be only allowed for the last
argument in a parameter list.

Finally we may wonder if it makes sense to specify a parameter of
type var varargs. If we try to pass a constant string this will
obviously not work, and if the compiler generates an array for us
it does also not work, the automatically generated array seems to behave
like a constant array. But may we pass an array variable? Let us try:

[source, nim]
----
proc print(s: var varargs[string]) =
  s[0] = "Goodbye"
  for el in s:
    stdout.write(el)
    stdout.write(", ")
  stdout.write('\n')

var msg = ["Hello", "World"]
print(msg)
----

Surprisingly that does not compile, while it works when
we replace varargs with openArray.

=== Procedures bound to a Data Type

In some other programming languages like Python or Ruby we can define
class methods or static methods which are bound to a class or type
and can be called as MyType.myProc. In Nim we can do something similar
by use of the typedesc proc parameter type:

[source, nim]
----
type
    Factory = object
        name: string

proc start(t: typedesc[Factory]) =
    echo "Factory.start"
    
Factory.start
----

Here we used the method call syntax instead of start(Factory). We will learn
more about the typedesc data type later.

=== Scoping , Visibility and Locality

Scoping, visibility and locality is an important concept in computer programming
to keep the source code clean. Imagine that a variable which we declare at some point
in our program would be visible everywhere. That would even for medium size
programs generate a lot of confusion -- whenever we would need a variable we would
have to carefully check which names are already in use. And for performance it would be
bad also, as all variables declared somewhere would reside permanently in  memory.

So most programming languages including Nim support the concept of locality --
names declared inside of a procedure body or inside another form of block are
only visible there and can only be used there. We say that they are only visible
in that scope. For Nim we can say that whenever Nim's syntax requires a new level of
indentation, that is a new statement block, then all symbols declared in that block
are only visible in that block and in sub-blocks of this block, but not outside of
that block. Nim has another important concept of visibility, which is called
modules and allows separation our code in logically separated text files with
well defined visibility rules, we will discuss modules later.

Visibility is really a simple concept, let us regard this useless example:

[source, nim]
----
var e: float = 2.7

proc p1 =
  var x: float = 3.1415
  if x > 1.0:
    var y = 2.0 * x
    echo y # OK
  echo x # OK
  echo y # compile error, y is not visible
  echo e # OK, e is declared globally, so it is visible everywhere

echo e # OK
echo x # ?
echo y # ?
----

In line one we declare a so called global variable, that one is visible
after declaration, that is below the line where it is declared, in the whole
program. The variables declared in the proc p1 are called local variables,
they are not visible outside of that proc p1. The variable x is declared
at the start of the proc body and is visible in the whole proc everywhere, while
variable y is declared in the if block and is visible only there. So
it should be clear if the last two echo statements for x and y compile fine?

Related to visibility of variables is their lifetime, that is
the duration how long they exist and how long they can store a value.
Global variables exist for the whole program runtime -- when you have
assigned a value to it that value can be used everywhere as long as the program
runs, and as long as you do not assign a different value of course.
Global variables are generally stored in a special memory region that is called the BSS
region.

Variables of value type defined locally inside a procedure or function do exist
only for the execution time of that proc, that is they are created when the proc
is invoked and vanish when the proc terminates, that is when execution
continues with the statement following on the proc call.

Local variables declared in a proc reside in a special memory region of the RAM which is called
the stack. The stack is nothing more than an arbitrary part of the hole RAM that is used in some
clever fashion: The memory words in it are used in consecutive order. A so called stack
pointer is used to indicate the address of the first free area in that stack. So when a 
proc is called, which may have n bytes of local variables, then the compiler can use
the area where the stack pointer points to for that variables, and when the proc 
is called then the stack pointer is increased by that size. So the stack pointer
points again to the next free area of the stack, and another proc can be called
in the same way from within the current proc. Whenever a proc terminates, the stack
pointer is set back to the value which it had when the proc starts execution.
This method of memory management is simple and fast, but it does only
work when the total amount of memory that the local variables in a proc 
needs is known at compile time, so that the compiler can adjust the
stack pointer accordingly. It does not work for dynamically sized data types
like strings or sequences.

Note that pointers and references are value types itself, we can regard 
pointers and references as a plain integer variable interpreted in a special way --
as a memory location. But the memory blocks to which the pointers and references 
may point and that is allocated by alloc() or new() is different: That memory blocks
are not allocated on the stack, but in the ordinary RAM which we call heap to
separate it from the stack.

So why can the stack not be used for memory blocks which alloc() or new() provides for us:
An important fact for the use of the stack to store variables is that
the total size which is needed by a proc for all the static variables must be a
compile time constant. The stack pointer is adjusted by that amount when the
proc starts and all the local variables are accessed with a fixed offset to
that stack pointer then. When we use alloc() or new() in a proc, then we may
call that multiple times like we did in our previous list example, and for
alloc() an additional fact is that the byte size that alloc() should reserve
can be a runtime value. So the total amount of ram that alloc() or new()
would allocate is a runtime value, and we can not use the stack for it. Instead
alloc() and new() allocates block of memory in a more dynamic fashion, which is
basically that they ask the OS for a free block of right size somewhere in the
available RAM. That block is later given back to the OS for reuse by functions like
dealloc() or automatically by the GC.

Let us at the end of this section investigate some special
cases:

While in languages like C we have always a well defined main()
function and all program code is contained in this function
or in other functions which are called from this main function, in Nim we have
also global code as in scripting languages Ruby or Python:

[source, nim]
----
var i: int
while i < 100:
  var j: int
  j = i * i
  echo j
  inc(i)
----

It should be clear that the global variable i resides
in the BSS segment. But what is with the variable j
declared in the body of the while statement? It is
clear that that variable is only visible inside
of the body of the while statement. But does
j reside on a stack? There seems to be no proc involved
so there may be no stack? The variable j may reside in the
BSS segment too? That is not really clear and may be different
for different Nim compilers maybe. But why should we care for
that detail at all? Well it may be important for performance.
Local proc variables allocated on the stack are generally
optimal for performance, and they are optimized by the compiler very
well. We will learn more about the reasons for that later when we discuss
the data cache. For now we should only remember that it may be
a good idea to avoid global code and put all code in procs. We
may have an arbitrary named main() proc then and call that from
global scope only. At least for the current {curnim}  that
seems to be a good idea, maybe later versions or other implementations
will automatically move all global code into a hidden proc for us.

NOTE: For optimal performance put all your code in procedures
or functions and avoid global code and when possible global variables.

Let us discuss above while loop again, but this time
in the body of a proc:

[source, nim]
----
proc p =
  var i: int
  while i < 100:
    let j: int = i * i
    echo j
    inc(i)
----

When we carefully investigate that proc within the while loop
we may wonder about two points. First we said earlier that we can
and should use the let keyword instead of var when there is 
only one assignment to a variable, so the variable can be 
regarded as immutable. But the loop is executed 100 times,
so how can we say there is only a single assignment to variable j?
The trick is, that j is locally to the while loop, and that j
is virtually new created and initialized to 0 for each iteration.
So let is OK and the compiler does not complain. 

We can test that fact with this simple program:

[source, nim]
----
proc main =
  var i: int
  while i < 10:
    var a: int
    a = a + 1
    echo a
    inc(i)
main()
----

The output is 1 for each loop iteration, as variable
a is virtually newly created for each loop iteration.

We said virtually newly created, because we can not be
sure how the compiler may handle it internally. Is storage
for variable a already allocated when the proc is invoked, that is 
in the same way as storage for the loop counter variable i is allocated 
on the stack when the proc is called. Or is storage for variable
a reserved for each loop iteration by increasing the stack pointer at the start
of the loop and resetting it at the end of the loop. We can not be sure without reading
the compiler source code, but finally we should not care, as it does not really matter.

=== Generics

In the previous section we defined a sqr() proc
for ints and one for float numbers. Both procs
look nearly identical, only the data types differ.
For that case we can use so called generic procedures.

[source, nim]
----
func sqr[T](v: T): T =
  var p: T
  p = v * v
  return p

echo sqr(2)
echo sqr(3.1415)
----

We put a square bracket after the function name which includes a
symbolic name, and that name is then used instead of concrete
types in the proc header or in the proc body.

We can now call that proc with parameters of different types including
int and float types. You may wonder why that works -- Nim is a statically
typed language, so how can the parameter of function sqr() as well
accept an integer as an float number? Is there a  hidden type conversion
involved? No, the trick is that whenever we call that generic proc with 
a different type, than a new proc or function is instantiated. As we called
the generic sqr() proc with an int and a float parameter, during compile time the
compiler creates machine code for two separate function, one which is
called when an int is passed as parameter, and one which is called when a float
is passed. If we would call that proc name again with an int or float parameter, than
one of the two existing procs would be used. But for a different, still unused
data type like float32 again a new proc would be instantiated. In this way generics
procs can lead to some code bloat. Note that calling the generic function
with a data type like a character or a string would fail, as that
types do not support multiplication with itself.

A slightly different notation is available by so called or types:

[source, nim]
----
func sqr(v: int or float): auto =
  var p: typeof(v)
  p = v * v
  return p

echo sqr(2)
echo sqr(3.1415)
----

Here we have limited the parameter types to the int type or the float type.
We could have defined also a custom type first, like type MyNum = int or float
and use that type for the type of our sqr proc. These [.code]#or types# are also called
[.code]#type classes#. Instead of keyword [.key]#or# the [.key]#|# character can be used for defining type classes.
Again the compiler would instantiate two separate functions for the
both data types. As we had not the symbolic type T available here, we have used the
keyword auto as return type, and for the type of variable p we used the macro
typeof(). The type auto for the return type works as long as the
function returns a well defined type. Note that we can not decide at runtime
what a type the function should return, so a construct like
if cond: return 2 else: return 3.1415 would not work, at least not when the
values are variables of different type. For the literal value it may work, as
the compiler may be smart and guess that we want to return the float literal 2.0.

A bit care is needed when we define procs for mutable [.code]#or types#:

[source, nim]
----
# proc t(s: var seq[uint8] | var seq[char]) =
proc t(s: var (seq[uint8] | seq[char])) =
---- 

Here we try to define a proc called t which should accept a mutable
seq[uint8] or a mutable seq[char] as parameter. While the first
line compiles fine, the seq[char] would be immutable. The correct notation
is shown in the second line. This behavior was labeled "won't fix" in
github issue tracker, so we have to remember this case, see
https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/15063#issue-665553657.

//=== xxx

Let us assume that you want to define a proc that accepts two
numbers of type int or float and that returns a float. You may write
it in one of this ways:

[source, nim]
----
proc sqrsum(x, y: int | float): float =
  (x * x).float + (y * y).float

proc sqrsum2[T](x, y: T): float =
  (x * x).float + (y * y).float

proc sqrsum3[T1, T2](x: T1; y: T2): float =
  (x * x).float + (y * y).float

var i: int = 2
var x:float = 3.0

echo sqrsum(i, x)
#echo sqrsum2(i, x)
echo sqrsum2(x, 2)
#echo sqrsum2(2, x)
echo sqrsum3(i, x)
----

The commented out lines would give you a compiler error. The reason
for this is that the proc sqrsum2[T] defines a generic proc, but
the compiler enforces that both parameters have the same type.
The expression [.code]#sqrsum2(x, 2)# compiles fine, as due to the first
parameter x the compiler instantiates a proc for a float parameter type, and then
converts the second parameter, which is an integer literal, to float automatically.
This automatic conversion is only done for literal numbers, not for variables.
The expression [.code]#sqrsum2(2, x)# does not compile, as due to the first parameter, which is
an integer literal, a proc for integer parameters is instantiated, and the second x parameter of float
type is not compatible with the instantiated proc.

Generics can become a bit complicated, as we may use multiple different
generic types for different proc parameters. And we can use generics also
for object types, we may for example create lists like we did for our names
list that work not only for strings, but that can work with other data
types like numbers or sequences in a very similar way. We may explain
that in more detail later.

=== Method Call Syntax

A useful coding style introduced by OPP languages is the method call
syntax, which was initially used in OOP programming style
for objects, and later applied by languages like Ruby to all
data types. Ruby in some way regards all data as objects.

Method call syntax means, that for example for a variable s of data type string
we do write s.add(c) instead of add(s, c). Or for an integer variable i we may
write i.abs instead of abs(i). That is we put the first parameter of the proc parameter list
in front of the proc name, and separate that parameter from the proc name by a period.
The compiler regards both notation as equivalent. The advantage of the method call
syntax is that we may save a character and that it is more clear with what "object"
we are working, as it stands in front of the expression.

Most OOP languages allows that notation only for a class, for example the string class
may declare all possible operations that can be done with strings, and the
method call syntax is used for that operations. One problem is, that it can
be difficult to add more operations which can be used in that style, as
often all that operations are defined in the class scope. Ruby fixed 
that restriction by allowing so called reopen of classes, that is user can 
later add more operations.

Nim simple allows that notation generally, as did the D language, but D used
the tern [.ndef]#Uniform Function Call Syntax# (UFCS) for it.

=== Procedure Variables

Procedures and functions are not always fully static entities.
We can assign procedures and functions to variables, and we
can pass whole procedures or functions as parameters
to other procedures or functions. And functions can even 
generate and return new functions. Let us investigate how
procedure variables work:

[source, nim]
----
var
  p: proc(i: int): int

proc p1(i: int): int =
  i + i

proc p2(i: int): int =
  i * i

p = p1
echo p(7)
p = p2
echo p(7)
----

The output of the two echo statements should be 14 and 49 -- we called in both
cases the same proc variable with the same parameter, but the proc variable p
was in the first call an alias for p1, and in the second call an alias for p2.
Note, when we assign a proc to a proc variable we do only write the name of that proc,
there is no () involved. That is because we assign that proc to the proc variable, but we do not call
the proc in this case. Of course, when we assign a proc to a proc variable then the proc signatures
have to match, that is the parameter list and the result have to be compatible.

Now we use a function as a proc argument.

[source, nim]
----
type
  EchoProc = proc (x: float)

proc t(ep: EchoProc; x: float) =
  echo "The value is"
  ep(x)

proc ep1(x: float) =
  echo "==> ", x

proc ep2(x: float) =
  echo x

t(ep1, 3.1415)
t(ep2, 3.1415)
----

A common use case for a function as a proc parameter is sorting.
We can use the same sort procedure for different data types
when we provide cmp proc that can compare that data type.

[source, nim]
----
from algorithm import sort

proc cmp(a, b: int): int =
  if a < b:
    -1
  elif a == b:
    0
  else:
    1

proc main =
  var a = [2, 3, 1]
  a.sort(cmp)
  for i in a:
    echo i

main()
----

The sort procedure is provided by the algorithm module.
The sort proc accepts an array or a sequence, and a
cmp proc that gets two parameters of the same type as
the elements in the passed array, and that returns
-1, 0, or 1 as the result of the comparison. We could
easily sort other data types like strings or our custom
objects by an arbitrary key, as long as we can provide
a matching cmp() proc. For the cmp proc it is important that it
returns a well defined result based on the input, and when
both parameters are equal it should really return 0. If you would exchange
the return values 1 and -1 in the cmp proc above, you would
invert the sort order.

=== Nested Procedures and Closures

While in C all functions must be defined in top level
scope and nesting of functions is not allowed, in Nim
procedures can contain other procedures. A special case
occurs when the sub-procedures do access variables of the outer
scope. In this case the sub-procedure is called a closure:

[source, nim]
----
proc digitScanner(s: string) =

  var pos = 0
  proc nextDigit: char =
    while pos < s.len and s[pos] notin {'0' .. '9'}:
      inc(pos)
    if pos == s.len:
      return '\x0'
    result = s[pos]
    inc(pos)

  var c: char
  while true:
    c = nextDigit()
    if c == '\x0':
      break
    stdout.write(c) 
  stdout.write('\n')

digitScanner("ad5f2eo73q9st")
----

When you run this program the output should be

----
52739
----

This program is not that easy, but when you think about it a bit
you should be able to understand it. The task is to extract
from a string all the digits and to ignore the other characters.

To get the digits, we use a local procedure that uses the pos
variable of the enclosing procedure, and also access the parameter
s of the enclosing procedure. The closure nextDigit() checks if
the position in the string is still valid, that is if it is still
smaller than the length of the string, and also checks if the 
current character is a digit. The first check uses the standard procedure
len() which return the length of a passed string parameter, that is how
many characters the string contains. We have used the method call syntax here instead of
using the ordinary proc call len(s). The next check test if the current
character is not  a decimal digit. For that test we could use a series of compares
like if c == '0' or c == '1' or ... or c == '9'. But to make such tests
easier and faster, Nim offers one more data type, the set type. And the notin
operator test if an value is not contained in a set constant.
//We will learn more about the set datatype later.
An important point for the expression
after the while statement is, that it is processed from left to right.
That fact is here important, because we have first to check if pos
is still a valid position, before we can use the subscript operator []
to access the current character and test if it is not contained in the set.
If the check for the valid position would not come first, then we may
access an invalid position in the string and we would get a runtime range error.

While the position is still valid but the current character is not a digit
we increase the position. The while loop can end by two conditions: Either
the current character is a digit, or we have reached the end of the string
and we have to stop. For the last case we use a special stop mark, we return a
special character which we have entered in  escape notation as '\x0'. That
is a very special character, that is used in C to mark the end of strings.
It is the first character in  the ASCII table and has the decimal value 0.
We said earlier that characters are encoded in 8 bit and correspond to
the unsigned integer numbers 0 up to 255. '\x0' is just a special notation
for the first character which corresponds to integer value 0. Well, when the end of the string is reached 
then we return that character. Otherwise we return the current character. Remember,
from the while condition we know  that string end is reached, or current
character is a digit. As we tested for string end before, we can only have the case
that current character is a digit now. But can we return that character
immediately now? If we would, s[pos] would be a digit, and we would
get exactly the same character for the next proc call! So we have to move
to the next character by increasing pos before we return that character.
For this the pre-declared result variable is useful. We assign the current
character to the result variable, and then increase pos. As the last
statement in our proc is not a expression but a plain inc() statement, the content
of the result variable is returned. The other while loop in the outer
procedure is very simple, we just call the closure in the body of the while loop
and terminate the loop when we get the special Null character.

And finally an example where one proc returns
another procedure:

[source, nim]
----
proc addN(n: int): auto = (proc(x: int): int = x + n)
 
let add2 = addN(2)
echo add2(7)
----

The output of echo would be 9 in this case. This
construct is sometimes named currying.

=== Converters

Nim's converters are a special variant of functions that are called
automatically by the compiler when argument types do not match.

[source, nim]
----
converter myIntToBool(i: int): bool =
  if i == 0:
    false
  else:
    true

proc processBool(b: bool) =
  if b:
    echo "true"
  else:
    echo "false"

var i = 7
processBool(i)
if i:
  echo "true"
else:
  echo "false"
----

With above converter we can pass an integer to a proc that expects a bool
parameter, and we can even use an integer as a logical expression in an
if condition in the same way as it is done in C language.
Converters do work only in a direct way, that is automatic chaining is not supported:
If we have one converter from character to int and one from int to boolean, that
does not mean that we can pass a character to a proc that expects a boolean. We would
have to declare one more converter that directly converts character to bool.

Whenever we do consider using converters we should think twice -- converters
may be confusing, may have some strange effects and may increase compile time.

Maybe you wondered why we wrote above converter in such a verbose way? Well
it was done intentionally, but you are right of course, we can write it just as

[source, nim]
----
converter myIntToBool(i: int): bool =
  i != 0
---- 

== Object Orientated Programming and Inheritance

Object Orientated Programming and Inheritance became very popular
in the early nineties of the last century. Java is a prominent
representative of that programming paradigm, but most languages
created in the nineties of the last century support it, like {cpp},
Ruby and Python.

The idea of OOP is that objects and procedures working on that objects
are grouped to classes, and that classes can be extended with
additional data fields and with additional procedures.
In OOP procedures and function are often called methods and
data fields are called members. Sometimes the members are completely
hidden and are accessed only by so called getter and setter methods.
That is called encapsulation. Encapsulation allows hiding implementation
details, so that that details may change when necessary, without
that the change of internal details become visible to users of that class, so
that the users can use the class without noticing the change.
Getters and setters also help hiding internal details and they
ensure
that the class is always in a consistent and valid state.

An important property of OOP is dynamic dispatch: When we create
various sub-classes of a common parent class, and we have defined methods
for all the sub-classes, then we can have collections of instances of different
sub-classes, and the compiler can automatically ensure that always 
the matching method for each instance is called.

A classical example is a drawing program, where we have different geometrical shapes
like rectangle, circle and many more. All the geometrical objects
are stored is some form of list, and when we want to draw all of them
on the screen then we have to call only an unspecific draw() method, and
the compiler ensures that for each shape the matching draw method
is called. In Nim that may look like

[source, nim]
----
type
  Shape = ref object of RootRef

  Rectangle = ref object of Shape
    x, y, width, height: float

  Circle = ref object of Shape
    x, y, radius: float

  LineSegment = ref object of Shape
    x1, y1, x2, y2: float

method draw(s: Shape) {.base.} =
  # override this base method
  quit "to override!"

method draw(r: Rectangle) =
  echo "drawing a rectangle"

method draw(r: Circle) =
  echo "drawing a circle"

method draw(r: LineSegment) =
  echo "drawing a line segment"

proc main =
  var l: seq[Shape]
  l.add(Rectangle(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 50))
  l.add(Circle(x: 60, y: 20, radius: 50))
  l.add(LineSegment(x1: 20, y1: 20, x2: 50, y2: 50))

  for el in l:
    draw(el)

main()
----

The output of that program is

----
drawing a rectangle
drawing a circle
drawing a line segment
----

So we can have a sequence of the base type, add various sub-types
and then iterate over the list to draw all the various sub-types.
Of course in the same way we could do many more task like
moving, rotating or storing all the objects in one call. The
compiler does the right dynamic dispatching for us, we have just
to provide all necessary methods. The need of the base method
seems to be a bit strange, some other OOP languages do not need that.
The base method is marked by a {.base.} pragma, we will discuss
the purpose of pragmas later. In the example we have used only one
level of sub-classing, but of course we can use many levels, for example
we can again subclass the Circle by a FilledCircle with a color field.

The OOP coding style can be very convenient for some tasks, one
important use case could be graphical user interfaces where
the graphical elements like labels, buttons, frames built
in natural way a hierarchical structure. Another typical 
use case are drawing applications with code similar to our basic example.

Not that the OOP style only works with ref objects, but not with value objects.
The obvious reason is that we can have collections of different
sub-types stored in arrays or seqences only for ref objects, as
in arrays and sequences all element types have to have equal size. For references
that it the case, as references are basically pointers. But different
value types would have different size. Linked lists would be no better
solution, as again we can not built lists with value objects.

For maximum performance OOP code with ref objects is generally not optimal, as
the dispatching itself needs some time, and as the ref objects
are not contained in a single block of memory, but are distributed
in the whole RAM, which is not cache friendly.

== Other Builtin Data Types

=== Tuples

Tuples can be regarded as some form of lightweight objects without
inheritance support, but mostly tuples are used when
functions has to return multiple arguments.

[source, nim]
----
type
  Move = tuple
    from: int
    to: int
    check: bool

proc findBestNextMove(): (dest: int; check: bool) =
  ...

let (dst, check) = findBestNextMove()
----

Here we define a custom Move type similar as we would do for
a custom object, but we do not use that type at all but
return an anonymous tuple from our proc, that is a pair of
an int and a bool.

Due to type inference our dst and check variables gets
the data types int and bool.

Tuples are also useful when a function has to return a value and
also an error state, or if it may not be able to return something
at all in a special case. For references we could return nil then, but
for results like int or float we may not have a well defined error
indicating constant, so we can return a tuple with an additional bool.
But we could use exceptions instead, or we could use Nim's option type
instead. We will learn more about that later.

=== Object Variants

Nim's object variants, sometimes also called sum types or abstract data types (ADT), are an
advanced and type save variant of the union type known from C.
The basic idea is that we may use value types that may
store similar, but not identical data. Untyped languages
like Ruby or Python allow that of course, and we can do
it in Nim with ref types and inheritance too, as we showed in a previous
section with our Shape base type and various geometric shapes.
We could store that ref types in arrays or sequences or linked
list and use dynamic dispatch for processing the various sub-types.
That is convenient but gives not maximum performance due
to dynamic dispatch at runtime and due to bad cache use.
So we may like to have a value type with different content, so
that we can store all the value types in a seq and all
entities reside in a compact block of memory for good cache use.

[source, nim]
----
type
  ShapeKind = enum
    line, rect, circ

  Shape = object
    visible: bool
    case kind: ShapeKind
    of line:
      x1, y1, x2, y2: float
    of rect:
      x, y, width, height: float
    of circ:
      x0, y0, radius: float

proc draw(el: Shape) =
  if el.kind == line:
    echo "process line segment"
  elif el.kind == rect:
    echo "process rectangle"
  elif el.kind == circ:
    echo "process circle"
  else:
    echo "unknown shape"

var
  s: seq[Shape]
s.add(Shape(kind: circ, x0: 0, y0:0, radius: 100, visible: true))
for el in s:
  draw(el)
----

Objects variants can have common fields like the boolean state visible above,
but the other fields are not allowed to use the same names, so we
had to use x0 and y0 for the names of the center coordinates in the cycle variant.

As you can see we can store all the different object variants as value objects
in a sequence and iterate over it. Note that object variants may waste some
storage, as all variants are silently enlarged to have the exact same size, so
that all variant types can be stored in an array or sequences and can be passed as
proc parameters in the same way to the same proc. 

== Iterators

We have already used some of Nim's standard iterators to iterate over the
characters of a string or the content of a sequence. Declaring
iterators is similar to declaring procedures, but we use the yield
keyword to return a single value back to the caller of the iterator.
Iterators are used in for loops, and the iteration continues until
the end of the body of the iterator declaration is reached the iterator terminates.
In an earlier section we declared a procedure that extracted the decimal
digits from a string. We can do the same with a iterator:

[source, nim]
----
iterator decDigits(s: string) =
  var pos = 0
  while pos < s.len and s[pos] notin {'0' .. '9'}:
    inc(pos)
  if pos < s.len:
    inc(pos)
    yield(s[pos - 1])

for d in decDigits("df4j6dr78sd31tz"):
  stdout.write(d)
stdout.write('\n')
----

Nim supports closure-iterators and inline-iterators. The later
have to be marked with the {.inline.} pragma in the header of the declaration.
Inline-iterators are inserted like templates at the location where they are
called and offer maximum performance, but each call increases the total
code size. Closure iterators are invoked like ordinary procedures, the
invocation eats some performance. Note: Iterators do not provide
a predefined result variable as procedures do. To avoid the need of
declaring a res variable of type character, in above code we increase pos
by one first and yield s[pos - 1].

== Templates

Nim templates are a more powerful variant of the macros in C.
While in C macros are processed by the pre-processor and 
are mostly just a plain text substitution, in Nim
templates are a fundamental part of the languages and
can be used in a similar way like procedures.
But while procedures built a single block of code
that is then called multiple times, templates work
like C macros as textual substitution. Wherever we call
a template the template source code is inserted.

[source, nim]
----
template sqr(i: int): int =
  i * i

var j: 7
echo sqr(j)
----

== Casts and Type Conversion

While we have various types of casts in C++, we have only one cast
and type conversions in Nim. In Nim casts just reinterpret the same
bit pattern for another data type. For example the boolean value false
is internally encoded as a byte with all bits cleared, and true is encoded
as a byte with all bit but the least significant one cleared. We could 
cast a bool to an int8 of same size and would get a decimal number 0 or 1.
Casting is not a real operation at all, as nothing is really done. We watch the
same bit pattern just from a different perspective. But casting is dangerous,
it violates the safe type system of the language, and it can go very wrong:
Can we cast between float64 and int64? Well they have same size, and both are numbers.
We can cast, but the result would be far away from what we may expect. While 
int64 has the well known and simple value encoding, that is rightmost bit stands
for 2^0, next bit for 2^1 and so far, the encoding of floats is much more
difficult and has not such a simple scheme. In floats some bits represent the so called mantissa
and some bits represent the exponent. When we cast we may again get a number, but
the value is not really predictable.
We have to be very carefully when we cast between types of different size. Nim may permit that
but we have to think what may really happen. When we cast between a bool and a int64, in one direction
7 bytes have to be ignored, and in the other direction for 7 missing bytes there is some
padding necessary. We do a cast by writing after the keyword cast in square brackets the
desired type followed by parenthesis enclosing the source variable:

[source, nim]
----
var i: uint8 = cast[unint8](myBoolVar)
----

Totally different to casting is type conversion. We can convert integers to floats
without problem, for the conversion we use the type like a proc call, that is int(myfloat)
or float(myInt) -- of course we could use method call syntax like myInt.float instead.
Type conversion is some effort for the CPU, but most advanced CPU's should have fast
instructions for basic conversion.

Nim generally only allows type conversions that involve not too much effort.
So we should not expect var i ="1234"; echo i.int * 7 to be available. Such a conversion
is expensive, at runtime it costs many CPU cycles as we would have to extract the digits, multiply
with it weight and sum them up. So for that operation functions like parseInt() are available from the Nim standard library
that accept a string as argument and return an int. There exists different variants of parseInt(),
one may raise exceptions for invalid input, the other may return a boolean.
 
== Exceptions

When we execute our code, sometimes something can go wrong: We may have an
unexpected division by zero or an overflow, or we get some invalid user input.
There exists various strategies to handle such situations. One is to terminate our program,
we may do that by a plain assert() or quit() statements. If we have absolutely no
idea how to recover from an error then that may be our best option. The user
may restart the program, or the program may be restarted by some sort of supervisor
program. For more expectable errors some sort of error indicator may be a better
solution, for example a parseInt() procedure may return a boolean value for
success. As we have to return the result for success also, the 
parseInt() proc may return a tuple, or may get a var parameter in which the result
is returned. Another solutions are exceptions as known from C++.

[source, nim]
----
proc charToInt(c: char): int =
  if c in {'0' .. '9'}:
    return ord(c) - ord('0')
  raise newException(OSError, "parse error")

proc main =
  while true:
    stdout.write("Please enter a single decimal digit: ")
    let s = stdin.readline
    try:
      echo "Fine, the number is: ", charToInt(s[0])
    except:
      if s.len == 0:
        break
      echo "Try again"

main()
----

This section has to be extended...

== Modules

Modules are Nim's way to divide multiple source codes in clearly
separated units and to hide implementation details. Nim use a module concept which is very similar
to Modula-2 or Oberon. All the Nim standard libraries are divided into
modules which collect and logically group data types and the related 
procedures. In some way modules are Nim's classes.

In Nim each module directly corresponds to one text file. Sub-modules
as known from Ruby, that divide a single text file in multiple modules are
not supported by Nim currently.

Every textfile with Nim source code is basically a module, and that module
can be imported and used by other modules. But all symbols like 
data types or procedures have to be exported to make them visible and usable
by other modules. That is done like in Oberon by appending an asterisk 
character to all names that should be exported. These restricted
exports allows to hide implementation details -- all symbols
not exported are private to that module and can be changed and improved 
at any time without noticing the importing module.

We can import whole modules, that is all symbols that are marked for
export by the asterisk, or we can import only the symbols that we need
by specifying their names. Let us create a module that declares a
single procedure to remove all characters from a string that are not
letters:

[source, nim]
----
# save this textfile with name mystrops.nim
proc remNoneLetters*(s: string): string =
  result = newString(s.len)
  var pos = 0
  for c in s:
    if c in {'a' .. 'z', 'A' .. 'Z'}:
      result[pos] = c
      inc(pos)
  result.setLen(pos)
----

We save above text file with our Nim source code with
name mystrops.nim and can import it like

[source, nim]
----
import mystrops

echo remNoneLetters("3h7.5g:8h")
----

Module names should be lower case and may as other Nim symbols only contain
letters, decimal digits and the underscore character.  

Note the export marker after the proc name. Instead
of importing whole modules we can import only single symbols
with the from x import y, z syntax like

[source, nim]
----
from mystrops import remNoneLetters

echo remNoneLetters("3h7.5g:8h")
----

Both forms are an unqualified import, that is we can
refer to the proc by only its name, we do not need
the qualified form with module name prefix like
mystrops.remNoneLetters() as long as there are no name conflicts.
But whenever we want we can use the qualified form also.

Nim programmer generally prefer importing whole modules and
use unqualified names, while
that is considered bad style in some other languages like Python.
In untyped languages like Python unqualified imports
may indeed pollute the name space and generate many name
conflicts, but in statically typed languages like Nim
unqualified import seems to generate name conflicts
only in very rare cases. Procedures with the same
name generally have different parameter lists, so
the overload resolution of the compiler can decide
what proc is to be used. And when really a name conflict
occurs then the compiler will tell us, and we can easily fix
it by prefixing the proc name with its module name.

For data types, constants or enums chances for name conflicts
may be not that tiny, so we may have to use qualified names.

We can also enforce a fully qualified import in Nim by a notation like

[source, nim]
----
from mystrops import nil
----

In this case we can use all symbols from that module only in qualified form.
But that does not always work that well in Nim, as Nim has not classes like
Java, so a qualified use of method call syntax or qualified use of user defined or overloaded operators
is difficult.
Imagine strutils.add(s, '\n'), how should that look with method call syntax?

For imports we have also the except keyword, so we may do something like

[source, nim]
----
import strutils except toUpper
----

The except keyword can be used to prevent possible name conflicts
without having to use qualified names.

Note that the system module is imported automatically, we should not import
it directly. Also note that Nim always imports only what is really needed
in the final executable, so importing only a few symbols from a module
has no code size benefit over importing the whole module. Still
it may improve readability of your code when you import only single
symbols when you are sure that you need not more. Maybe like from
math import Pi. Note that you can even in that case access other
symbols of that module by fully qualified names like math.sin().

With the growing standard library it may occur that module 
names of the standard library interfere with your own module names.
So Nim now allows and recommends qualified import of modules
from the standard library like import std/strutils. And
for external packages installed by the nimble package manager
imports in the form import package/[mod1, mod2, mod3] are permitted. 

Finally you can also import modules under another name using the [.key]#as#
keyword like

[source, nim]
----
import tables as maps
----

With the recent Nim compiler you can also enforce full qualified import and use of
an alternate module name by using an import statement like

[source, nim]
----
from tables as maps import nil
----

With this import statement you could access symbols from the tables module
only by use of the maps module prefix like maps.newTable().

== Include

The include statement should be not confused with the import statement.
Include just insert a text file at the position where the include
statement occurs. Include can be used to split very large modules
in smaller entities.

== Strange Questions

=== How do I make a sequence with multiple data types?

=== Is there a way to return multiple different data types from a function?

=== Is it possible to import a file from a variable?

=== How can I delete a variable?

== ASCII Table

  echo "Visible ASCII Characters\n"
  stdout.write("     ")
  for i in 0 .. 15:
